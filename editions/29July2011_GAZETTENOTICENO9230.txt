REVOCATION OF LAND TITLES
WHEREAS the parcels of land whose details are described under the Schedule herein below were allocated and titles issued to private developers, it has come to the notice of the Government that the said parcels of land were reserved for public purposes under the relevant provisions of the Constitution of Kenya, the Government Land Act (Cap. 280) and the Trust Land Act (Cap. 288).  The allocations were therefore illegal and unconstitutional.
Under the circumstances and in view of the public need and interest, the Government revokes all the said titles.
