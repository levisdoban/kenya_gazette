ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY REPORT FOR THE PROPOSED ONSHORE HYDROCARBON EXPLORATION  DRILLING IN BLOCK 1, KONTON AREA, WAJIR COUNTY
INVITATION OF PUBLIC COMMENTS
PURSUANT to regulation 21 of the Environmental Management and Co-ordination (Impact Assessment and Audit) Regulations, 2003, the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) has received an Environmental Impact Assessment Study Report for the above proposed project.
The proponent (Afren – East African Exploration (K) Ltd) is Proposing to drill an exploration well for oil and gas in Block 1 - Konton Area, Wajir East Constituency, Wajir County.
The proposed activities include site preparation, equipment assemblage, well foundation, rig building, drilling and restoration of the well site.
The following are the anticipated impacts and proposed mitigation measures:

Activity And Possible Impacts


Mitigation Measures


ACCESS ROADS
-   site vegetation clearing for site access road
-   possible localised increase in soil erosion
-   localised changes in surface hydrology
-   dust emission from access roads
-   vibration and noise from moving equipment to and around site


 
-     limit vegetation clearing to absolute minimum
-     limit activities that increase soil erosion
-     channel storm flow to designated drainage pathways
-     enforce use protective gear at all times
 


DRILLLING OPERATIONS
Site preparation: -
-     Increased soil erosion and compaction
-     dust emission
-     reduced vegetation at rig site


-     reduce movements of machinery to absolute minimum
-     limit vegetation clearing around site


Drilling :-
-     Disturbance
-     Fatigue,
-     High possibility of accidents to drill staff
-     Occupational health & safety risks
-     Noise disturbance
-     Consumption of water resources
-     Site restriction hence no access to site pasture
-     Oil pollution through possible operation accidents


-     Ensure all persons wear protective gear at all time
-     Ensure workers operate on reasonable time shifts to avoid fatigue;
-     Follow all safety procedures at the rig site
-     Operations should be restricted within defined operation area and access roads
-     Ensure active communication with community to address emerging issues especially on employment and security
 


BASE CAMP
Ø Lose of vegetation around site
Ø Change in site runoff
Ø Restriction to pasture at camp
Ø Camp Activities - Noise / Light


-     Minimize clearing of vegetation to absolute minimum
-     Day time operations are recommended
-     Install base camp water source
-     On decommissioning of operations the borehole can be handed over to the local community


WASTE DISCHARGE
Ø waste paper, bottles, litter and spills around rig site and base camp


-     All non-biodegradables should be incinerated or ferried to waste management sites outside the Camp
-     All organic waste should be composted


Ø Clinic Waste - Biomedical waste disposal
 
 


-     Ensure safe handling, treatment, and disposal of biomedical waste
-     Segregate waste and recycle all recyclable waste
-     Hazardous waste should be sealed in containers and buried


CULTURAL BREACH
-     Physical presence of Survey Team –
-     Interference with grazing land due to pasture restriction around site
-     Employment conflicts
 


-     Ensure drilling staff have minimum contacts with local community
-     Staff should respect community culture
-     Non-technical and semi-technical jobs should be given to locals
-     Community Liaison  Officer should engage the community to identify those to be employed


SECURITY
-     Vulnerability to attacks by terrorists
-     Clan conflicts


 
-     ensure adequate security is in place
-     ensure community liaison officer engages community on employment matters



DECOMMISSIONING AND DEMOBILIZATION



-     Ensure restoration of site to a ration of 2:1 of the original status
-     Notify county Govt. on plans to demobilize and/or decommission
-     Settle all obligations before date of demobilization
-     -      Notify staff in time before  demobilization/ decommissioning

The full report of the proposed project is available for inspection during working hours at:
