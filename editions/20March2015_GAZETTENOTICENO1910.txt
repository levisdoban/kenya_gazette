CHAPTER I—INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background
The Constitution of Kenya, 2010 divides the territory of Kenya into forty-seven counties as specified in the First Schedule, one of which is Elgeyo Marakwet County. The Constitution further vests sovereign power in the people of Kenya. This sovereign power is exercised at two levels:
(a) National level; and
(b) County level.
The objectives of devolution under Article 174 of the Constitution include:
To promote democratic governance and accountable exercise of power.
To foster national unity by recognizing diversity.
For self governance and the participation of people in decision making on matters that affect them including development.
To protect interests and rights of marginalized groups.
To promote social and Economic development and bring services closer to the people.
To ensure equitable sharing of resources.
To enhance checks and balances and separation of powers.
The Constitution has conferred on county governments various executive, legislative and oversight functions intended to achieve these objectives. In addition, the county governments have the power to manage and co-ordinate county administration and its departments so as to ensure effective and efficient public service delivery. In doing this, they are enjoined to reflect the guiding principles of devolution as set out in Article 175 of the Constitution which include:
1. That county governments shall have reliable sources of revenue to enable them to govern and deliver services effectively.
2. That the county governments shall be based on the democratic principles and separation of powers to enhance and promote democracy and accountability in the exercise of power.
3. Ensure gender representation
Whether or not the county governments fully realize the objectives of devolution much will depend on the existence in the counties of legal and institutional frameworks to effectively and efficiently deliver services to the people. Some of the frameworks have been established by the Constitution itself while others are to be created through legislative measures at the county and national levels. Among these is the institutional framework to establish and maintain in each county, in accordance with section 56 of the County Governments Act, a professional and efficient Public Service that will ensure responsive, prompt, accountable, effective and economic use of resources.
1.2 Establishment of the County Public Service Board
Article 235 of the Constitution requires every county to be responsible for the establishment of a County Public Service in accordance with uniform norms and standards prescribed by an Act of Parliament. Accordingly, section 57 of the County Governments Act establishes a County Public Service Board for every county. The board comprises a chairperson, not less than three and not more than five members and board secretary, all of whom are nominated and appointed by the Governor with the approval of the County Assembly.
County Public Service Boards (CPSB) are devolved governance units established for the purpose of establishing and managing professional, effective and efficient public service to enable the county governments achieve the objectives of devolution.
1.3 The powers and functions of a County Public Service Board
The powers and functions of a County Public Service Board are set out in section 59 of the County Governments Act and relate to public officers in the county public service. Broadly, a County Public Service Board is, responsible for—
(a) establishing and abolishing offices in the county public service;
(b) appointing persons to hold or act in those offices, and confirming appointments;
(c) providing for the organization, staffing and functioning of the countypublic service in ways that ensure efficient, quality and productiveservices for the people of the county;
(d)      advising the county government on human resource development and management and utilization that best enhances service delivery by county public service institutions;
(e) providing for human resource management and career development practices to address staff shortages and barriers to staff mobility;
(f)  facilitating the development of coherent, integrated human resource planning and budgeting for personnel emoluments in counties;
(g) making recommendations to the Salaries and Remuneration Commission, on behalf of the county governments, on the remuneration, pensions and gratuities for county public service employees; and
(h) exercising disciplinary control over and removing persons holding or acting in those offices;
The County Public Service Boards responsibility is also to promote, in the County Public Service, the values and principles set out in Articles 10 and 232 of the Constitution. They evaluate and report to the county assemblies on the extent to which the values and principles are complied with in the County Public Service and provide standards to promote ethical conduct and professionalism in county public service. Further, CPSBs advise county governments on implementation and monitoring of the county performance management systems and prepare regular reports for submission to the county assemblies on the execution of the functions of the boards.
1.4 The composition of the EMCPSB
The County Public Service Board (the Board) was sourced competitively and sworn into office on 25th June, 2013. The board is comprised of a Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson(1), four (4) Members and a board secretary.

Six employees retired in the period under review.

2.2 Disciplinary Actions
In the year under review, two disciplinary cases were reported which culminated in issuance of warning letters. The two are still being handled at the departmental levels.
2.3 Board Internal Projects
2.3.1 Roll out of County Human Resource Information System
To improve efficiency in the recruitment process, the board rolled out the County Human Resource Information System. This marked the beginning of online recruitment, selection and management of staff in the county. The system has improved the board's efficiency by reducing turn-around time, and the amount of paper work in its operations, especially recruitment.
2.3.2 Roll out of County Document Management System
To improve efficiency in the management of records and information sharing, the board procured a document management system which is being used to manage all information from stakeholders and staff records.
2.3.3 Office Space
In the month of January, 2014, the board sourced for space from the office of the Sub-county Administrator, K. N. Currently, the office accommodates the Board, Sub-county Administration and Department of Physical Planning.
Glass partitioning of the offices has been undertaken and is yet to be completed. The board requires a total space of 4200 sq ft, and currently has 100 sq ft. Plans are in place to build an ablution block with modernized lavatory facilities for both males and females.
2.3.4 Board Strategic Plan
A Strategic Plan is a tool used by the management of institutions to achieve both short term and long term objectives. It enables an institution to bring the future closer by planning for it and clearly spelling out the risks that may hinder the achievement of its objectives. Measures are then put in place to ensure that the risks are managed well.
The County Public Service Board, in consultation with its stakeholders (Executive, County Assembly Committee on ICT and Public Service, Unions, Professional Bodies and PSC) is in the process of formulating its Strategic Plan 2015–2019 which is expected to be launched early 2015.
During the year, the board attended five day training on Corporate Governance at the centre for Corporate Governance. The course content included but was not limited to:
 
Boards and their Functions.
Role of Board Chair, Members and Secretary/CEO.
Board Dynamics.
Management of Boards.
Company Social Responsibility.
Board Reporting.
2.4 Regularization of Staff on Secondment
The county inherited staff from the National Government and the three Local Authorities of Tambach /Iten, Keiyo and Marakwet. To harmonize them, the board designed a staff regularization process where positions are advertised internally and staff are encouraged to apply. The process involved the Board visiting staff in the sub-counties to sensitize them on taking up positions competitively.
This process aims at achieving three major objectives:
Motivating staff who wish to serve in positions other than their current posting.
Reducing excesses in departments by lateral movement of staff (Removing excesses and filling deficits).
Reducing the County Wage bill by sourcing from within.
2.5 Advisories to the Executive
The board established the HR advisory and management committees. The HR Advisory Committee comprises the County secretary as the Chair and director of HR as the secretary. All chief officers are members.
The committee will be responsible for approving promotions, discipline management and administration of schemes of service in consultation with the board as and when the need arise.
In the same meeting, the board delegated some of its functions to the chief officers as provided for by the section 86 of the County Government Act, 2012.
2.6 Training
The board recommended to heads of department to set aside 30 per cent of their administration budgets for training and induction of staff. Newly appointed staff are inducted within three months of employment to enable them discharge their duties well. Further, the board delegated the management of training of staff to chief officers. All departments send employees for training and capacity building.
2.7 Sensitizations for regularization with the support of PSC
The board conducted sensitization exercise in all the four sub-counties. The exercise was supported by the two major unions in the county and PSC, and was attended by PSC commissioner Veronica Birgen.
The emphasis of the sensitization was to encourage all employees to show interest by applying for advertised positions in the county.
2.8 Staff Motivation Initiatives
The board rolled out staff motivation initiatives such as review of terms, rolling out the process of procuring for medical cover for all employees, and working on the pensions. It has also spearheaded the process of ensuring there is promotions and trainings.
2.9 Performance Contracting
Performance contracting was rolled out starting with the County Governor and the Executive, and the same is being cascaded downwards.
2.10 Housing of Staff
Salaries and Remuneration Commission has provided for a policy on provision of mortgage for all staff. The board will work with the treasury and other entities to ensure that county staff are facilitated to take advantage of the facility which will provide housing for all county staff.

3.3 Challenges experienced in the year 2014
In the year under review the Board faced the following challenges
(a) Conflicting mandates on human resource management areas such as responsibility for performance management, pensions, and development of organization structure left grey areas in execution of the mandates. The role of the County Assembly, the Executive Committee, the board, the offices of county secretary, CEC, HR and the line departments need to be clarified.
(b) Preference for manual access to information and processes by stakeholders including staff reduced efficiencies of existing ICT platforms. Low ICT network coverage in the county leading to limited access to information including application of jobs. Huge training needs of county staff were exacerbated by inadequate funding. Late introduction of performance management system delayed achievement of key objectives.
(c)  Resistance to change delayed release of funds to the board. The board will open its own operational bank account and establish a procurement unit to enable requisitioning and execution of its procurement needs.
(d) Resource Allocation. The resources allocated to the board are not sufficient to actualize the roles of the CPSB. The board will work closely with the Executive Committee and County Assembly Committee to ensure sufficiency of resource allocation.
CONCLUSION
The board is unwavering in its commitment to execution of its functions and powers as provided in both the County Government Act, 2012 and the Constitution of Kenya, 2010. it is only through this commitment that the Vision of an excellent County Public Service will become a reality.
Dated the 24th January, 2015.
