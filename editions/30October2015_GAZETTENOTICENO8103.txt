IN EXCERCISE of the powers conferred by section 44(3) of the Wildlife Conservation and Management Act, 2013, the Cabinet Secretary for Environment and Natural Resources Gazettes the Plan in the Schedule hereto.
SCHEDULE
The Amboseli Ecosystem Management Plan (hereinafter referred to as “the Plan”) defines the principles and strategies that Amboseli stakeholders have designed to address wildlife conservation, tourism development, and community livelihood issues in the Amboseli eco-system.
The Plan emphasizes that all developments within the Amboseli Ecosystem shall be in accordance with the Plan and guiding principles outlined in the Plan’s Strategic Environmental Assessment report.
The Plan is a dynamic document that shall be subject to periodic reviews, depending on emerging issues and new knowledge.
The success of the Plan hinges on stakeholders’ commitment to follow through with strategic implementation of various activities under the Plan. There shall be a Plan Implementation Committee (hereinafter “the Committee”) to co-ordinate and oversee the implementation of the Plan. The committee shall be an advisory body established under the Amboseli Ecosystem Trust. The committee shall meet regularly and communicate with Plan implementers and other relevant stakeholders with enough frequency to ensure that the Plan remains a living document.
The committee shall comprise representatives from Kenya Wildlife Service, Amboseli Tsavo Group Ranches Conservation Association, Amboseli Ecosystem Trust and other government and nongovernmental agencies co-opted by these three organizations.
The committee shall perform the following functions —
(a) co-ordinate the implementation of the Plan;
(b) mobilize resources for Plan implementation;
(c)  monitor and evaluate the progress of activities;
(d) identify constraints in plan implementation;
(e)  produce annual progress reports on plan implementation; an
(f)   recommend review of the management plan.
The Plan addresses threats to Amboseli ecosystem’s conservation values through a zonation scheme and five management programmes. Implementation of the Plan’s zonation scheme and management programmes is expected to result in sustainable conservation and management of natural resources in the Amboseli Ecosystem.
The Plan’s zonation scheme and management programmes are outlined in the following sections —
ZONATION SCHEME
The Amboseli Ecosystem’s zonation scheme seeks to —
(a) Separate incompatible land uses;
(b) Maintain ecosystem connectivity;
(c)  Provide diverse types of tourism experience; and
(d) Reduce tourism pressure on Amboseli National Park.
This is achieved through dividing the ecosystem into three broad land use zones (Arable Agriculture Zone, Livestock Production Zone, and Wildlife Tourism Zone) and three visitor use zones (High Use Zone, Exclusive Use Zone, and Low Use Zone).
MANAGEMENT PROGRAMMES
The Plan has five management programmes (Ecological Management Programme, Tourism Development and Management Programme, Community Partnership and Conservation Education Programme, Security Programme, and Ecosystem Operations Programme). Each management programme contains management objectives that set out the future desired state that Kenya Wildlife Service and its partners aim to achieve, and a set of specific management actions to achieve these objectives. In addition, to facilitate plan implementation, each management programme has a three year Activity Plan, which breaks down the individual management actions into day-to-day management activities.
