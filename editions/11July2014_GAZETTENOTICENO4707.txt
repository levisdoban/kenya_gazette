WHEREAS Judy Wanjiru Kamau, is the registered proprietor of that piece of land known as Laikipia/Nanyuki West/Timau Block 2/319 (Matanya/Marura), situate in Laikipia District, and whereas sufficient evidence adduced proves that the said land title was erroneously issued, and whereas all efforts made to compel the registered proprietor to surrender the said land title deed issued in respect of the said piece of land to the land registrar for cancellation have failed, notice is given that after the expiration of thirty (30) days from the date hereof, provided no valid objection has been received within that period, I intend to dispense with production of the said land title deed and give a new title deed to the rightful owner, Agnes Wanjiku Ngunje, and upon such publication the land title issued earlier shall be deemed to be cancelled and of no effect.
Dated the 11th July, 2014.
