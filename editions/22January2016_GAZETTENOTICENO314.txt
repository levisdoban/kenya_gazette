The County Government Act Section 59 provides:
(3) The reports under subsection (1)(d) shall contain the details of persons appointed including gender, persons with disabilities, persons from the minority and marginalized communities.
Table II—below gives a summary of the distribution according to gender, persons living with disability and non-dominant communities recruited in the period under review.
Table II—Summary of Recruitment distribution according to Gender, Persons Living with Disability (PLDWs) and Non-Dominant Communities
It is paramount to note that all advertisements to fill vacant positions encourage people living with disability (PLWDs) and people from non dominant communities to apply, the applications from these two categories are however few and some of the applicants do not meet the minimum requirements for the positions.  This makes it difficult to attain the legal threshold of Gender 1/3 ;PLWDs 5% and None dominant Communities 30%.
It is worthy to note that the Gender and Disability Development Centre, awarded Kiambu County for the second time in a row with the award of "Diversity and Inclusion, Most Progressive County" the theme was "Celebrating Diversity and Inclusion Indicators in; leadership, governance and excellence in service delivery in Kenya' This took place in a colorful ceremony held at on 4th December, 2015

RETIREMENTS IN 2015
During the year under review a total of 135 staff members attained the age of retirement and were removed from the payroll system
CASUAL WORKERS
Prior to devolution casual workers were being engaged to carryout work that requires to be done on permanent basis.  The law does not allow engagement of casual workers for more than three months.  In addition the casual workers tend to claim entitlement for permanent terms if engaged for more than three months at a time.  This sometimes results in civil suits being filed against the County Government
In order to address this problem the Board has required that an exercise be carried out to determine the numbers and the appropriate terms of engaging such workers without breaking the law.
This problem is prevalent in the Department of Water, Environment and Natural Resources which is charged with the responsibility of ensuring cleanliness in the urban areas of the County.
INTERNSHIPS & ATTACHMENTS
The County Government Act provides:
74. The County Public Service Board shall regulate the engagement of persons on contract, volunteer and casual workers, staff of joint ventures and attachment of interns in its public bodies and offices.
In a gesture of giving back to society the Public Service Board allows training through internships and attachments.  The trainees are attached to the departments in areas relevant to their training.  This creates potential for the trainees as future employees of the County.
PROMOTION OF ARTICLES 10 AND 232 OF THE CONSTITUTION
The County Government Act, 2012, sections 59(1)(e), 59(4)(a) and (c) provides:
 “59. (1) The functions of the County Public Service Board shall be, on behalf of the county government, to—
(e)  promote in the county public service the values and principles referred to in Articles 10 and 232;
 (4) In the performance of its functions under subsection (1)(e), the County Public Service Board shall have powers to—
(a)  inform and educate county public officers and the public about the values and principles;
(c)  assist county government in the formulation and implementation of programmes intended to inculcate in public officers the duty to uphold the values and principles;”
During the year under review the Board visited all the Sub-Counties in order to educate the county public officers on the principles and values of public service and to get a feel of the challenges in the sub counties.  This would help in knowing  how to address them.  This was the second visit by the Board to the Sub-Counties in the new dispensation.
During the visits, the Board members addressed the sub county staff members and covered the  followingaspects
Change management
Change management under the concept of devolution was emphasized in order to inculcate into the employees the need to embrace change from the conventional public service delivery to one that is more efficient  and effective.
It was pointed out that change management is a systematic approach to dealing with change, both from the perspective of an organization and on an individual level. There is need to change from the cultures, practices, habits, attitudes of the corrupt defunct local government and former national government public service to an efficient, effective public service under the devolved government .
The desired change should be seen in:
reporting to work on time
being organized at work
being accurate in work and avoiding gossip
locating files and other documents quickly
minimum use of telephones during working hours
receiving and respecting customers
practising friendly, polite public relations
respecting seniority and being subordinate
helping the lower level staff through motivation
taking health breaks for tea and lunch
keeping appointments with customers
taking leave when due
This is in adherence of the principles of public service delivery under section 116 of the County Government Act and Article 232 of the Constitution of Kenya which results in ultimately taking the public service closer to the people.
Etiquette/Public Relations
The staff were addressed on etiquette and public relations issues, the right language to use in the office, dress code and matters to do with punctuality and service to the public.
Structures of County Government and its Departments/ national values and principles
The Board created awareness on the hierarchy of the County Government and informed the staff that for efficient and effective management of the County, the leadership must work as a team for synergy in the service delivery to the public. It was pointed out that involvement and active participation of the public is critical at every stage as stipulated in Articles 10 and 232 of the Constitution of Kenya. Public involvement and participation would ensure inclusivity and non-discrimination. This is the only sure way of involving the public in decision making in pertinent issues within the County. In every forum, there should be representation of all the stakeholders.  In the event that people with disability are dismally represented, the leadership should reach out to this group through their respective organizations.
At the onset of devolution, fourteen (14) functions  were devolved. These were merged to form the current operational ten (10) Departments namely:
Health Services.
Finance and Economic Planning.
Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries.
Education, ICT, Culture and Social Services.
Youth Affairs,Sports and Communications.
Trade, Industry, Tourism and Co-operative Development.
Roads, Transport, Public Works and Utilities.
Water, Environment and Natural Resources.
Lands, Housing and Physical Planning.
Administration and Public Service.
Each Department is headed by Chief Executive Committee Member (Minister) at the policy level and a Chief Officer who manages day to day running of the Department.
At the Sub-County level, these departments are co-ordinated by the Sub-county Administrator.
National Values and Principles
According to the County Government Act, the Board will promote in the county public service the values and principles referred to in Articles 10 and 232.
In the performance of the Board's functions set out under section 59(1)(e) of the County Government Act, the County Public Service Board shall have powers to:
inform and educate county public officers and the public about the values and principles;
assist county government in the formulation and implementation of programmes intended to inculcate in public officers the duty to uphold the values and principles;”
For this reason, the Board encouraged the employees to adhere to national values and principles which are monitored through performance of assignments. The performance must be efficient and effective if the achievement of the desired results is to be achieved. The following values must be adhered to by all officers:
Accountability
Transparency
Integrity
Inclusivity
Non-discrimination
Equality
The County Public Service Board’score mandate is recruitment of staff for the County.  In recruitment, the Board ensures compliance with:
One-third (1/3)gender rule
30% from non dominant community in the County
5% people living with disability
Disciplinary procedures
The issue of discipline in the public service was highlighted as an inherent part of human resource management. It is used as a guiding tool to create order and organization in the service. The ultimate aim of disciplinary action is to:
ensure officers achieve high standards of ethical conduct and work performance.
provide fair and consistent means of dealing with breaches and deficiencies which may cause reduction of ethical and/or performance standards, in order to create a more motivated and dedicated work force.
In this regard the Board is responsible and accountable for disciplinary control in the county public service (Article 235 (c) of the Constitution). The Board also has the power to delegate in writing any part of the function (section 86 (1) of the County Government Act.
The procedures followed are:
1.  A show cause letter must be issued to the affected officer by his/her supervisor or authorized officer. The letter must indicate the specific offence for which an officer is being charged, the date(s) on which the alleged offence(s) was/were committed and reasonable period within which to respond to the charge.
2.  Investigations must be carried out immediately the disciplinary process begins. The officer should be away for a specified period to enable investigations to be carried out. This period is referred to as interdiction or suspension. The disciplinary case should be processed and disposed of expeditiously (Article 47 (1) of the Constitution on fair administrative action).
Punishment imposed upon officers include:
Reprimand (a written warning letter)
A severe reprimand (a very serious warning letter)
Recovery of costs for loss or breakage caused by default/negligence except where the Authorized Officer/County Government has made recovery through surcharge
Deferment of increment (to suspend or postpone)
Withholding of increment (to keep, retain, hold back)
Stoppage of increment (to bring to a halt)
Reduction in seniority
Dismissal
Retirement in the public interest.
Personal health
The importance of keeping well was emphasized.  It is not easy to meet all the needs of the public. It is stressful due to high demands from the people. For this reason, all staff must take care of their health continuously.
Wellness consists of one’s physical, emotional, mental,  and spiritual well-being.
Research shows that there is direct relationship between personal health and success. The staff were therefore encouraged to check their health to remain healthy, productive and successful.
During the sub-county visits the Board was able to highlight areas that needed to be addressed in order to enhance service delivery of the public service.  Some of these included:-
Office Space
There is inadequate office space for Sub- County, Ward Administrators and the new recruits. This was being  addressed to ensure conducive working environment.
Harmonization of Salaries
There are major disparities in remuneration between devolved staff, defunct local authorities staff and new recruits. This is causing dissatisfaction among the various cadres. In an effort to address the problem, the Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC) has embarked on job evaluation to harmonize skills and pay which shall take some time before completion. For this reason, SRC will be requested to conduct meetings with the Counties to address the dissatisfaction and sensitize the workforce as this is their mandate.
Identity Cards and Entry Permit letters
Disaster management staff (eg. fire fighters), enforcement officers, development monitoring and control officers and revenue collection officers require identity cards for identification while executing their duties. This was in hand.
Rehabilitation Centres for alcoholics
Alcoholism is a major problem within the Sub-Counties among employees as well as the members of the public. Therefore, there is need  for construction and equipping rehabilitation centres to address the withdrawal symptoms associated with recovering addicts which may result in death if left unchecked.
Medical Scheme
Comprehensive medical cover for Sub-County and Ward Administrators as well as for the new members of staff would be initiated.
The challenges that were highlighted during the Sub County visits are already being addressed by the relevant departments in the County.
POLICIES
The Board has developed the following policies which will facilitate in service delivery and management of staff in the County:-
1.     Board Charter
2      Code of Conduct & Ethics
PROMOTIONS
The County Government Act provides:
Provisions on appointments to apply to promotions.
70. (1) The provisions of this Act and regulations or procedures made under this Act that apply to appointments shall also apply to promotions.
The Public Service Boardinitiated the formation of Advisory Committees in each County department.  These Committees are charged with the responsibility of carrying out disciplinary measures at departmental level, handling staff welfare matters and making recommendations for promotions for staff who merit and have served in the Government for three years. The relevant Departments and the Finance Department are both required to confirm budgetary allocation for the proposed promotions before the promotions are carried out.
In 2015 the Board carried out the first phase of promotions in a three phase exercise for staff in the Health Services Department.
RECOGNITION AGREEMENT
Kiambu County is one of the counties that has not experienced industrial unrest in the health sector that has been prevalent in other counties in Kenya.  The Public Service Board initiated the signing of a Recognition Agreement with the Kenya National Union of Nurses,  Kiambu County branch in order to amicably address staff grievances.
Here below is a photograph of the ceremony
BOARD SEMINARS

Devolution presents opportunities and challenges to the health system that together determine the effectiveness of service delivery and the character of the overall health system. On average, 50% - 60% of county workers are in the health sector. The sector is facing various challenges that threaten Health system built management in the country since devolution.
Devolution presents opportunities and challenges to the health system that together determine the effectiveness of service delivery and the character of the overall health system.

CONCLUSION
I wish on behalf of the Board and the Secretariat staff to record our appreciation to His Excellency the Governor for his unreserved recognition of the Board as an independent entity in the delivery of it’s mandate. Secondly, The Assembly, The Executive and the entire workforce for the co-operation and harmonious working relationship mutually cultivated.
In view of the fact that the devolution is a route no one has travelled before in Kenya, it cannot be over emphasized that its success can be more easily achieved through harnessing and concentrating of all stake holders in a united effort pulling in the same direction.
Finally, I wish to commend members of the Board and the Secretariat for the undivided support and respect they have accorded me individually and collectively throughout the year, without which the degree of success in the delivery of the Board’s mandate would not have been achieved.
JUSTIN N. KIMANI,
MR/8406422                                                       Chairman.
