WHEREAS Joyce Wambui Wachiuri, of P.O. Box 168, Karatina is the registered proprietor of that piece of land containing 1.21 hectares or thereabout, known as Kirimukuyu/Thiu/534, situate in the district of Nyeri in the Republic of Kenya, and whereas all evidence adduced show that the said Joyce Wambui Wachiuri has fraudulently acquired the said title deed known as Kirimukuyu/Thiu/534, and whereas as all effort made to compel the registered proprietor to surrender the said title for cancellation have failed, notice is given that after the expiration of thirty (30) days from the date hereof, provided no valid objection has been received within that period, I intend to dispense with the production of the said land title deed and proceed to register the original owner in the name of Francis Wambui Wachiuri, and upon such dispensation and registration the land title deed issued earlier to the said Joyce Wambui Wachiuiri, shall be deemed to be cancelled and of no effect.
