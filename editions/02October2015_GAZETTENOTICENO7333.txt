Title of the Project
Applicant
Location(s) of Experiment
Objective
Date of Approval
1
Application for contained use activities involving the development of a transformation system for common beans, tepary bean, Arabidopsis thaliana and tobacco; and, to identify factors involved in plant-aphid interactions under contained laboratory, greenhouse and growth chambers
International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI)
BeCA-Hub ILRI, Nairobi
The objective of the proposed contained use experiment is to develop a reproducible Agrobacterium tumefasciens mediated genetic transformation procedure for common bean, tepary bean, Arabidopsis and tobacco, and study the effect of the viral silencing suppressing genes VSR 2b and HC-Pro in mediating the aphid-plant interactions
