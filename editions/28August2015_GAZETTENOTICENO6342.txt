DETAILS OF THE TARIFF STRUCTURE
The tariff structure describes how the average tariff is distributed amongst the different consumer groups and the block in each category. An increasing block tariff has been approved for residential, commercial and Government institutions. Kiosks and schools are charged at a constant rate, independent of their consumption volume, as they serve consumers in the lower income brackets.
