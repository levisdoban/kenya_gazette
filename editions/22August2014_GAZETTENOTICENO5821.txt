INVITATION OF PUBLIC COMMENTS
PURSUANT to regulation 21 of the Environmental Management and Co-ordination (Impact Assessment and Audit) Regulations, 2003, the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) has received an Environmental Impact Assessment Study Report for the above proposed project.
The proponent (Samwel Nyalle) proposes to construct a service station in Chasimba area, Kilifi County. The project will consist of the following: Structural steel canopy, concrete driveway to provide access into and from the service station, underground storage tank measuring 1500 x 1000 mm, 4 No. of fuel-dispensing pumps, 5 No. of toilet-rooms, a tire pressure device, a store, septic tank and soak pit.
The following are the anticipated impacts and proposed mitigation measure:

Impact


Proposed mitigation measures


Water and soil contamination


Safety and emergence response plan to be developed with emphasis on protection of environment.
No uncontrolled discharges.


Increased fire and safety risks


Place fire extinguisher at conspicuous sites.
