THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY REPORT FOR THE PROPOSED CEMTECH LIMITED STAFF HOUSING ESATE PROJECT SEBIT, WEST POKOT COUNTY, KENYA
INVITATION OF PUBLIC COMMENTS
PURSUANT to regulation 21 of the Environmental Management and Co-ordination (Impact Assessment and Audit) Regulations, 2003, the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) has received an Environmental Impact Assessment Study Report for the above proposed project.
The Proponent (Cemtech Limited) is proposing to construct 300 Staff Housing Estate project at Sebit/Chepchoi sites in Pokot County.
The proponent proposes to construct 300 Staff Housing units categorized as types A to D for staff in descending level of cadre or seniority. Type A will have two bedrooms and a guest room each, type B will be smaller and two bedrooms each, type C will have two bedrooms each but smaller in size compared to that of a type B house and type D will have one bedroom each. Respective square areas covered by each unit for the categories A to D are 195 m2, 100 m2, 80        m2 and 45 m2. Types B to D will be arranged such that they are house clusters of one storey. Play grounds, school and hospitals are part of the plan and will be implemented in a different phase.
 The following are the anticipated impacts and proposed mitigation measures:

Impacts 


Mitigation measures 


Air pollution


Suitable wet suppression techniques need to be utilized in all exposed areas.
All unnecessary traffic must be strictly limited on site speed controls are to be enforced.
Ensure that the site is located away from such pollution sources.
Use of unleaded fuel to be encouraged.
Use of bicycles within the estate to be encouraged.


Solid waste generation
 


Use of an integrated solid waste management system i.e. through a hierarchy of options: 1. Source reduction 2. Recycling 3.Composting and reuse 4. Combustion 5. Sanitary land filling.
Provide solid waste handling facilities such as rubbish bags and skips.
Ensure that solid wastes generated at the housing units are regularly disposed of appropriately at authorized dumping sites.
Ensure that occupants of the housing units manage their waste efficiently through recycling, reuse and proper disposal procedures.
Donate redundant but serviceable equipment to charities and institutions.
A private company to be contracted to collect and dispose solid waste on regular intervals.


Vegetation and animal disturbance
 


Ensure proper demarcation and delineation of the project area to be affected by construction works.
Specify locations for trailers and equipment, and areas of the site which should be kept free of traffic, equipment, and storage.
Designate access routes and parking within the site.
Preserve of some individual trees within the site.
Introduction of vegetation (trees, shrubs and grass) on open spaces and their maintenance.
Design and implement an appropriate landscaping programme to help in re-vegetation of part of the project area after construction.


Increased storm water, runoff and soil erosion
 


Surface runoff and roof water shall be harvested and stored in underground reservoir for reuse.
A storm water management plan that minimizes impervious area infiltration by use of recharge areas and use of detention and/or retention with graduated outlet control structure will be designed.
Apply soil erosion control measures such as leveling of the project site to reduce run-off velocity and increase infiltration of storm water into the soil.
Ensure that construction vehicles are restricted to existing graded roads to avoid soil compaction within the project site.
Site excavation works to be planned such that a section is completed and rehabilitated before another section begins.
Roof catchments will be used to collect the storm water for some domestic uses.


Dust emission
 


Ensure strict enforcement of on-site speed limit regulations.
Avoid excavation works in extremely dry weathers.
Sprinkle water on graded access routes when necessary to reduce dust generation by construction vehicles
Personal Protective equipment to be worn.


Exhaust emission
 


Vehicle idling time shall be minimized.
Alternatively fuelled construction equipment shall be used where feasible equipment shall be properly tuned and maintained
Sensitise truck drivers to avoid unnecessary racing of vehicle engines at loading/offloading points and parking areas, and to switch off or keep vehicle engines at these points.


Noise and vibration
 


Sensitise construction vehicle drivers and machinery operators to switch off engines of vehicles or machinery not being used.
Sensitise construction drivers to avoid gunning of vehicle engines or hooting especially when passing through sensitive areas such as churches, residential areas and hospitals.
The noisy construction works will entirely be planned to be during day time when most of the neighbours will be at work.
Ensure that all generators and heavy duty equipment are insulated or placed in enclosures to minimize ambient noise levels.


Incidents, accidents and dangerous occurrences
 


Ensure that provisions for reporting incidents, accidents and dangerous occurrences during construction using prescribed forms obtainable from the local Occupational Health and Safety Office (OHSO) are in place.
Enforcing adherence to safety procedures and preparing contingency plan for accident response in addition safety education and training shall be emphasized.


Fire protection
 


Firefighting equipment such as fire extinguishers and hydrant systems should be provided at strategic locations such as stores and construction areas.
Regular inspection and servicing of the equipment must be undertaken by a reputable service provider and records of such inspections maintaine.
Signs such as “NO SMOKING” must be prominently displayed within the estate, especially in parts where inflammable materials are stored.


Oil Spills


A designated garage section of the site fitted with oil trapping equipments to be planned for changes. Such a area will be well protected from contaminating the soil.


Mushrooming of informal settlement


Control of informal activities around the project site.

The full report of the proposed project is available for inspection during working hours at:
(a) Director-General, NEMA, Popo Road, off Mombasa Road, P.O. Box 67839–00200, Nairobi.
(b) Principal Secretary, Ministry of Environment and Mineral Resources, NHIF Building, Community, P.O. Box 30126-00100, Nairobi.
(c) County Director of Environment, West Pokot County.
The National Environment Management Authority invites members of the public to submit oral or written comments within thirty (30) days from the date of publication of this notice to the Director-General, NEMA, to assist the Authority in the decision making process of the plan.
