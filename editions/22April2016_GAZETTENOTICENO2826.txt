THE ENERGY ACT
(NO. 12 OF 2006)
OPERATION OF THERMAL GENERATION PLANTS IN THE ELECTRICITY SUPPLY SYSTEM
PURSUANT to the provisions of sections 5, 6 and 25 of the Energy Act, 2006, the Energy Regulatory Commission wishes to notify the general public that it has received an application from thermal power generation licensees, Kenya Power and Lighting Company Limited and Fuel Suppliers to thermal power plants. The Commission has reviewed the application and orders that:
(a) The Fuel Supply Agreements can be renegotiated to adjust the stock holding levels in light of the reduced dispatch of thermal power plants.
(b) The   application for a change in the economic merit order of dispatch in the interconnected grid is disallowed. An exception will be allowed where the plants are run to maintain them in an operable mode as recommended by the manufacturer.
These decisions are based on the objects and mandate of the Commission as provided under sections 5 (b), 6 (h), (l) of the Energy Act.
Dated the 19th April, 2016.
