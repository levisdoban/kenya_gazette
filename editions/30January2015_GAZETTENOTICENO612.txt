This report covers the period from 2nd January 2014 to 31st December 2014.
The period under review is very significant in a number of ways. This includes; the undertaking of County Capacity Assessment and Rationalization Programme (CARPs) by the national government in collaboration with the County Government and County Public Service Boards. I am pleased to note that, we have so far done our best. We didn’t do it alone of course. All along the way, we had a wonderful support of the executive arm of Government, the County Assembly and other stakeholders. Included in this report, are the trainings attended by the Board Members and other senior officers where we had an insight on the best practices.
I wish to mention that, we are committed to developing new structures for this county as required in the new constitution dispensation in line with our mandates, national values, principles of governance and values and principles of Public Service. To sum up, may I take this opportunity to thank the secretariat team for their selfless support, the Executive arm of the government, County Assembly of Turkana and the general public for their continued support.
Thanks
