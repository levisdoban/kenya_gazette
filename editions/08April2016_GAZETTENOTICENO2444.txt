THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY REPORT FOR THE PROPOSED MALINDI SOLAR POWER PLANT (40MW) IN WERU GROUP RANCH NO.19 IN LANGO BAYA LOCATION, MALINDI DISTRICT IN KILIFI COUNTY
INVITATION OF PUBLIC COMMENTS
PURSUANT to regulation 21 of the Environmental Management and Co-ordination (Impact Assessment and Audit) Regulations, 2003, the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) has received an Environmental Impact Assessment Study Report for the above proposed project.
The proponent, Malindi Solar Group Limited, is proposing to construct a 40 MW Solar PV power plant in Malindi District, Kilifi County. The site is approximately 125 km northeast of the City of Mombasa and 40km west of the centre of Malindi town along Malindi – Kakoneni – Lango Bara road (C103) and 20 Km from KETRACO 220 kV substation at Kakuyuni.
The following are the anticipated impacts and proposed mitigation measures:

Possible Impacts


Mitigation measures


Impacts on flora, fauna, avifauna, habitat loss destruction, disturbance and displacement


Clearing vegetation only in construction areas and demarcating areas where no clearing will happen.
Rehabilitation or ecological restoration during and after the construction phase will be undertaken with locally indigenous plants.
Maintaining of re-vegetated areas after rehabilitation has taken place.
Ensure that all human movement and activities are contained within designated construction areas in order to prevent peripheral impacts on surrounding natural habitat.
Vehicles coming into the site must use designated roads.
The wet area next to the panels will be fenced to prevent any disturbance on the fauna within the shallow water pan.
Educate all contractors as to the importance of the avifauna on the site and the importance of avoiding disturbance to it as far as possible.
Implement tree planting program within the farm to offset any loss of trees.


Noise impact


Using mechanical equipment with noise suppressing technologies in order to reduce the noise-rating as much as possible.
Install portable barriers to shield compressors and other small stationary equipment where necessary.
Providing workers with PPEs against noise.
Control earthworks.
Install drainage structures properly e.g. ear plugs.
Placing signs around the site to notify people about the noisy conditions.
Regular maintenance of equipment to ensure they remain efficient and effective.
Construction and decommissioning should be carried out only during the specified time which is usually from 0800hrs to 1700 hrs, where permissible levels of noise are high and acceptable.
There should not be unnecessary horning of the involved machinery.
Drivers to adhere to speed limits within the project site access roads and vicinity.
Construction of sound proof walls round the sub-station to reduce on the impacts of noise to the surrounding environment, through a plastic fence or phonic barrier if necessary.


Loss of top soil, soil compaction and soil erosion


Restricting of vegetation soil cover to those areas necessary for the project development.
Sprinkling water on the soil to prevent dust from rising.
Creating specific paths for the trucks.
Ensuring there is enough space for normal percolation of water.
Landscaping.
The disturbed areas should be rehabilitated with indigenous vegetation as soon as possible to prevent soil erosion if it was necessary.
Proper installation and configuration of drainage structures to ensure their efficiency.


Impact on surface and ground water
 
 


During construction, the design (of the drainage systems) should ensure that surface flow is drained suitably in to the public drains provided to control flooding within the site.
The channels should be designed with regard to the peak volumes such as periods or seasons when there is high intensity of rainfall in case such an event occurs.
They should never at any time be full due to the resulting heavy down pours.
The drainage channels should ensure the safe final disposal of runoff/surface water and should be self-cleaning which means it should have suitable gradient.
Soil stockpiles should be protected from wind or water erosion through placement, vegetation or appropriate covering if it was necessary.
Proper drainage control such as culverts, cut off trenches should be used to ensure proper management of surface water runoff to prevent soil erosion.
Cleared or disturbed areas should be rehabilitated with indigenous vegetation as soon as possible to prevent erosion and loss of biodiversity if it was necessary.
Fuel, oil and used oil storage areas should have appropriate secondary containment (i.e. bunds) to prevent underground water contamination.
Vehicles and machine will be properly surfaced and well maintained to reduce risk of potential oil and fuel spills and leakages.


Air quality (dust and vehicle emission)
 


Sprinkling water on soil before an excavation and periodically when operations are under way to prevent raising of dust.
Spray stock piles of earth with water.
Avoid pouring dust materials from elevated areas to ground.
Cover all trucks hauling soil, sand and other loose materials.
Sensitize construction workers.
Provide dust masks for the personnel in dust generation areas.
Regular maintenance and services of machines and engines.
Controlling the speed and operation of construction vehicles.
Use clean fuels e.g. Unleaded and de-sulphurized fuels if clean fuel is available.
Vehicle idling time shall be minimized
Alternatively fuelled construction equipment shall be used where feasible.


Traffic impact


Placing signs around the site notifying other vehicles about the other traffic and to set the speed limit around the site.
Ensuring all drivers for the project comply to speed regulations.
Making sure the construction doesn’t occupy the road reserves and complying to traffic and land demarcation obligation.
A grievance procedure will be established where by any complaints by the project’s neighbors are recorded and responded to.


Generation of waste


Development of waste management plan (WMP) following the principals of waste minimization at source, segregation for re-use, recycling as well as treatment and disposal of waste.
Following EMCA regulation on waste management, legal notice 121.
Using waste minimization techniques such as buying in bulk and creating opportunities for regulation. Reducing, Re-using, Recycling, Recovering, rethinking and Renovation.
Creating waste collection areas with clearly marked facilities such as color coded bins and providing equipment for handling the waste. The bins should be coded for plastics, rubber, organics, glass, timber, metals.
Allocating responsibilities of waste management and identifying all sources of wastes and ensuring wastes are handled personnel licensed to do so especially for hazardous waste.
Making available suitable facilities for the collection, segregation and safe disposal of the waste.
Effluent and storm water runoff will be discharged away from water courses (drainage channel).
Steel off –cuts will be reused or recycled , as far as possible.
Any used oil stored on site must be stored in impervious container.
Special attention shall be paid to the sanitary facilities on site.
Garbage shall be disposed off periodically.


Health and safety impacts
 


Employing an OSH plan that will outline or OSH risks and provide a strategy for their management.
Ensuring all potential hazards such as movable machine parts are labeled.
Rising awareness and educating workers on risks from equipment and ensuring they receive adequate training on the use of the equipment.
Providing the workers with adequate PPEs and monitoring regulatory to ensure they are replaced on time when they wear out.
Placing visible and readable signs around where there are risks.
Providing firefighting equipments and creating safe and adequate fire and emergency assembly points and making sure that they are well labeled.
Providing firefighting equipments and in easily accessible areas as well as ensuring site personnel are well trained to use them as well as maintaining them regularly.
Labeling chemicals and material according to the risks they possess.
Creating safe and adequate fire and emergency assembly points and making sure they are well labeled.
Ensure dustbin cubicles are protected from animals, rains and are well covered
Proper treatment of waste water.
The proponent should ensure that the project site is properly fenced as well as employ guards to prevent children from tempering with the heavy machinery.
