1.0           Introduction
 Article 1 of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010, provides that all sovereign power in Kenya belongs to the people of Kenya and is exercised at two levels, the national and county levels of government. Further, Article 6 (1) divides the territory of Kenya into forty-seven counties at which the sovereign power is exercised at the county level. Pursuant to and in accordance with Article 176, each county shall have a county government consisting of a county executive and a County Assembly. The functions of the two levels of government are specified and spelt out under Articles 186 and 187 as read together with the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution.
In order that  a county  government is able to carry out its functions and perform its responsibilities, Article  235 (1) of the Constitution empowers and confers on County governments responsibility, within  a framework  of uniform norms  and standards  prescribed by an  Act of  Parliament, for establishing  and abolishing offices in its  public service, appointing persons to hold  or act  in those  offices, confirming appointments and  excising disciplinary control over such persons. This framework is contained in the County Governments Act, 2012, which, under section 57, establishes a County Public Service Board for each county.
