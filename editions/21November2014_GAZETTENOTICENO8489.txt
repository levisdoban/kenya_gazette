THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY
DRAFT STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REPORT FOR PROPOSED RED CORAL DEVELOPMENT IN LIMURU, KIAMBU COUNTY
INVITATION OF PUBLIC COMMENTS
PURSUANT to regulation 42 and 43 of Environmental (Impact Assessment and Audit) Regulations, of 2003 the National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA) has received a Draft Strategic Environmental Assessment Report for Proposed Red Coral Development in Limuru, Kiambu County. The SEA findings are also expected to integrate the existing sectoral plans and programs to establish sustainable urban development mechanisms.
The primary goal of Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) is to provide a high level of protection to the environment by integrating environmental considerations at the earliest stage in the plan-making process with a view to promoting sustainable development and informing the draft development plan of any significant environmental impacts.
The Proposed Red Coral Development plan proponent – Red Coral Properties Limited is in possession of a 387-acre parcel of land on the outskirts of Limuru town and is desirous of developing the land to meet the growing demand for housing, commercial and light industries developments away yet proximal to the Nairobi City Centre. Red Coral Properties Limited has thus commissioned a Strategic Environmental Assessment of the proposed development master plan.
The objective of the Proposed Red Coral Development plan is to provide a quality environment which affords pleasant, clean and safe mixed communities for living, work and play away from the Capital City. Execution of the plan will contribute in the meeting part of the housing demand in the Nairobi Metropolitan region as well as provide choices and options for existing residents wishing to live in a high quality environment provided with a wide range of amenities and easy access to services and employment opportunities.
The Proposed Red Coral Development SEA study entailed the following:
(a) Collection of baseline information on the physical, biological and socio-cultural environment as identified during the scoping studies. This also included extensive review of legislative framework with the bearing on the plan and assessment of its compliance with the legislation;
(b) Stakeholders’ engagement to deliberate on the Proposed Red Coral Development plan and identified alternatives;
(c)  Analysis of the environmental and socio-economic baseline data to identify trends, opportunities and constrains in relation to Proposed Red Coral Development plan;
(d) Identification, prediction and qualification of the significant environmental and social impacts of the Proposed Red Coral Development plan, evaluation of alternatives including their direct, secondary and cumulative effects, and selection of suitable alternatives that enhance environmental and social benefits; and
(e)  Identification of measures to enhance opportunities and mitigate adverse impacts.
The key potential management strategies and the recommended activities are highlighted below:

Category


Management Strategy of the Proposed Red Coral Plan 


Recommendations


Physical setting and biodiversity


Provide for appropriate measures that guarantee the protection of the physical and biological environment


Maintain as much as possible the natural drainage systems and patterns;
Begin landscaping activities as soon as construction begins; and
Set out a landscaping plan for re-vegetation of disturbed areas and prioritize indigenous trees and shrubs in the choice of plants.


Energy resource management


Conserve energy resources


Ensure the use of rated equipment in welding and related works;
Maintain equipment and equipment to manufacturers specifications by regular servicing to maintain efficiency in combustion and reduce carbon emissions;
Use environmentally friendly fuels such as low sulphur diesel; and
Minimise the period for machinery idling to save on fuel;
Create awareness to staff and other establishments within the development the need to conserve energy;
Install and maintain energy efficient appliances e.g. indoor lights and outdoor security lights; and
Continually seek avenues for energy conservation as international best practices evolve.


Air Quality,
Noise and vibrations


Abate pollution of the atmosphere by reducing emissions and prevention of noise pollution and vibrations


Sprinkle water on work areas and materials heaps to minimise dust emissions;
Maintain equipment and equipment to manufacturers specifications by regular servicing to maintain efficiency in combustion and reduce carbon emissions;
Use environmentally friendly fuels such as low sulphur diesel;
Ensure there is no burning of waste is done on site; and
Provide appropriate PPEs e.g. dust masks & ear muffs to site workers.
Install portable hoods to shield compressors and other small stationary equipment where necessary;
Endeavour to use equipment installed with noise abatement devices;
Reduce idling time on machinery, trucks and other noisy equipment;
Encourage drivers to turn off vehicle engines when not in use;
Carry out construction work during the day only;
Ensure regular maintenance of generators and the incinerators to maintain high combustion efficiency;
Ensure the continual planting and maintenance of vegetation to act as carbon sinks;
Carry out noise and excessive vibration monitoring and mapping as found appropriate; and
Maintenance of vegetation that attenuates noise within the development.


Soil resource management


Prevention of degradation of soil resource


Use the excavated soils to create buffers and berms during landscaping;
Identify fertile soil borrow-pits near the site;
Ensure immediate re-vegetation of the disturbed sites;
Ensure construction vehicles use predetermined tracks to minimise soil compaction;
Allow sedimentation of construction waste waters to minimise the amount of soil lost during construction;
Oils, fuels, paints and all hazardous materials should be stored well to avoid leakages and spillages;
Implement erosion and sedimentation controls and ensure proper disposal of waste waters.


Water resource management


Conserve water resource through lowering the consumption levels in the development


Apply measures for preventing soil erosion;
Avoid extravagant use of water and avoid wasteful use of water;
Seek approvals from relevant authorities before abstraction of underground water;
Monitor water consumption and maintain records;
Harvest storm water to supplement other sources of water;
Establish silt fences;
Channel construction waters to sediment traps;
Recycle and reuse construction waste waters;
Incorporate water accounting systems and metring for all areas;
Encourage all stakeholders in the Red  Coral to conserve water through awareness programs;
 Install and maintain low volume fixtures in toilets, baths and other wet areas;
Use recycled and harvested storm water in cleaning and watering the lawns; and
Continually seek new avenues for water conservation as international best practises evolve.


Traffic management


Develop and observe traffic management plans


Ensure construction vehicles do not cause nuisance through obstructions and speed limits;
Develop and maintain a traffic management plan that caters for vehicular and pedestrian traffic associated with the development;
Set up traffic control/warning signs; and
Advance discussions with Kenya Railways to make the railway station a reality for the development.


Health and safety


Provide proper safety equipment, facilities and conditions that will eliminate the risks to all


Comply with OSHA 2007  and other relevant legislations that govern health and safety at workplaces;
Access to the active construction sites shall be controlled by hoarding the construction sites and posting warning signs to the general public;
Provide appropriate signage and warning in the potential risk areas;
Provide appropriate PPEs to staff;
Provide first aid facilities and train workers on emergency response e.g. First aid;
Provide adequate sanitary facilities;
Develop and implement a detailed site specific Emergency Response Plan; and
Comply with the requirements of the ILO code of practice for safety at work places.


Raw materials management


Conservative use of raw materials.


Source construction materials from registered and approved quarries and sand harvesting firms;
