1.        Statement of Corporate Governance
 
The Central Bank of Kenya (the “Bank”) is wholly owned by the Government of Kenya. The Bank is established by and derives its authority and accountability from Article 231 of the Constitution of Kenya. The Bank is committed to maintaining the highest standards of integrity, professionalism and business ethics in all its operations.
 
1.1.      Board of Directors
 
The Central Bank of Kenya Act provides that the Board of Directors shall be composed of a Chairperson, a Governor, the Principal Secretary to the National Treasury, who is a non-voting member and five Non-Executive Directors including the Chairperson. Previously, all the Board members were appointed by the President of the Republic of Kenya. With effect from 2nd May, 2012, the Act was amended and now requires under Sections 11(2A) and 13(1) that the Chairperson of the Board and the Governor of the Bank, respectively, be appointed by the President through a transparent and competitive process and following the approval of Parliament.  The current Directors, in line with the provisions of the Act, Section 12 (1C), elected an Interim Chairperson from amongst the members to preside at meetings of the Board until a substantive Chairperson is appointed.  Consequently, Dr Mbui Wagacha was on February 11, 2013 elected to preside at meetings of the Board. Other than the Principal Secretary to the Treasury who is ex-officio, all the Non-Executive Directors of the Board are appointed by the President of the Republic of Kenya. All the Board members are appointed for terms of four years each and are eligible for reappointment provided that no Board Member holds office for more than two terms.
 
There are five Non-Executive Directors namely Dr Mbui Wagacha, Mr John Gerin Msafari, Ms Vivienne Yeda Apopo and Ms Florence Kagendo Muindi who are all serving their first term and Prof William Otiende Ogara who is serving his second term. All the Non-Executive Directors are independent of management and free from any business or other relationship, which could interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
 
The Board meets once every two months and has a formal schedule of agenda items due for deliberations. The Directors are given appropriate and timely information to maintain full and effective control over strategic, financial and operational issues. The Board is not involved in the conduct of day-to-day business as this is the responsibility given to the Governor by the Act. It, however, retains responsibility for determining the policy of the Bank.
 
The Members of the Board as at 30 June 2014 and their attendance of the 13 meetings held in the year were as follows:

1.6     Management Structure
 
The Central Bank’s Senior Management team is made up of the Governor, the Deputy Governor and the heads of the Bank’s various departments as indicated on earlier page.  The positions of Governor and Deputy Governor are set out in the CBK Act Cap 491 of the Laws of Kenya.  The Senior Management meets regularly to review the overall performance of the Bank.
There are several other management committees, which advise the Governor on specific issues in order to enable him to discharge his responsibilities as the Chief Executive Officer of the Bank.
 
1.7        Code of Ethics
 
The Bank is committed to the highest standards of integrity, behaviour and ethics. A formal code of ethics for all employees has been approved by the Board and is fully implemented. All employees of the Bank are expected to avoid activities and financial interests which could give rise to conflict of interest with their responsibilities in the Bank. Strict rules of conduct apply to the entire Bank’s staff under the staff rules and regulations.
 
1.8     Internal Controls
 
Management of the Bank has put in place a series of internal control mechanisms to ensure the reporting of complete and accurate accounting information. Procurement of goods and services is strictly done in accordance with the Public Procurement & Disposal Act, 2005. In all operational areas of the Bank, workflows have been structured in a manner that allows adequate segregation of duties.
 
1.9     Authorizations 
 
All the expenditure of the Bank must be authorized in accordance with a comprehensive set of Bank policies and procedures.  There is a budget and a procurement plan that is prepared and approved by the Board before commencement of the financial year.  The Board of Directors receives regular management accounts comparing actual outcomes against budget as a means of monitoring actual financial performance of the Bank.
 
1.10   Internal Audit and Risk Management
 
The internal audit function is performed by Internal Audit Department. Risk Management Unit is a separate function under the Banking Department and is responsible for monitoring and providing advice on the Bank’s risk management framework.  All reports of the Internal Audit Department and Risk Management Unit are availed to the Audit Committee of the Board.
 
1.11   Transparency
 
The Bank publishes an Annual Report, Monthly Economic Review, Weekly Releases, Statistical Bulletin and Bi-annual Monetary Policy Statement which explains current monetary policy and also provides the expected monetary policy stance. In addition, the Bank issues policy briefs to the Treasury on both the monetary and fiscal policies.  On an annual basis, the financial statements are published in the Kenya Gazette and are also placed in the Bank’s website.
 
2     Financial Performance
 
The Bank’s financial performance is affected by monetary policy undertaken, money supply, interest rates and exchange rate. The Bank’s financial performance is presented on page below of these financial statements.
 
During the financial year ended 30 June 2014, the Bank’s net interest income after impairment charge was Shs 4,757 million (2013: Shs 1,912 million). The increase is due to reduction of monetary policy expenses attributed to the stance taken by the Monetary Policy Committee.
 
The Bank’s unrealized foreign exchange gains went up significantly to Shs 14,759 million (2013: Shs 5,623 million) due to increased levels of foreign exchange reserves together with a weakening shilling in the year under review.
 
Net trading income mainly generated from sale of foreign currency increased to Shs 2,245 million (2013: Shs 1,699 million) due to movements in major foreign currency exchange rates and major government repayments during the year.
Operating expenses increased significantly to Shs 12,177 million (2013: Shs 9,404 million) as a result of the write off of the unamortized portion relating mainly to the cost of currency notes in issue in the year of Shs 1,254 million following a change in the estimated useful lives of the various currency notes denominations. See note 2(t). The cost of currency coins also increased by Shs 780 million in the year to Shs 1,756 million (2013: Shs 976 million). Staff expenses increased by 7% to Shs 3,899 million (2013: Shs 3,645 million).
 
Currency costs are expected to significantly increase in the next financial year (2014/15) as the Bank plans to issue new generation currency to comply with constitutional requirements.
 
The outcome of the Bank’s operations was a net surplus of Shs 13,504 million (2013 restated: Shs 3,573 million) which has been added to the general reserve fund.
 
The financial position for the year is set out on page below.
 
The amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits effective for the period starting on or after 1 January 2013 have been applied by the Bank for the first time. The revised standard requires that all actuarial gains and losses arising in any given year be recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. The largest impact of the adoption has been an increase in the pension asset relating to unrecognized actuarial gains posted to other comprehensive income as a prior year adjustment.  This has led to an increase in 1 July 2013 opening pension asset by Shs 5,141 million. Additional disclosures have been made in the financial statements in accordance with the revised standard in notes 2 and 17 to the financial statements. The retrospective effect of the standard has been incorporated on the financial statements, including the inclusion of a third column in the Statement of Financial Position relating to the restated position at 30 June 2012, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standard requirements.
 
The Bank’s assets increased to Shs 854,604 million (2013 restated: Shs 595,530 million) fostered by receipts from diaspora, receipt of the $2bn Eurobond in June 2014 and movement in exchange rates in the year.
 
Liabilities on the other hand increased to Shs 784,212 million (2013: Shs 537,470 million) due to higher liquidity as evidenced by higher deposits from banks and government at Shs 448,800 million (2013: Shs 191,671 million), currency in circulation at Shs 199,966 million (2013: Shs 183,047 million) and IMF at Shs 130,064 million (2013: Shs 118,568 million).
 
The Directors submit their report together with the audited financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2014, which shows the state of affairs of Central Bank of Kenya (the “Bank”).
 
Incorporation
 
The Bank is incorporated under Article 231 of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010.
 
Principal activities
 
The Bank is established and administered under the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 with the principal object of formulating and implementing monetary policy directed to achieving and maintaining stability in the general level of prices. It is also the responsibility of the Bank to foster liquidity, solvency and proper functioning of a stable market-based financial system. The Bank also acts as banker, advisor and fiscal agent of the Government of Kenya.
Results and dividend
The surplus for the year of Shs 13,504 million (2013 restated: Shs 3,573 million) has been added to the general reserve fund. The Directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend (2013:  Nil).
Board of Directors
The Board of Directors who served during the year and up to the date of this report are listed on page above.
Auditors
The Bank is audited by the Auditor General in accordance with Section 12 of the Public Audit Act and the Central Bank of Kenya Act.
 
By order of the Board
 
K. K. ABUGA
Board Secretary, 2014
 
The Directors are responsible for the preparation of financial statements for each financial year that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Bank as at the end of the financial year and of the Bank’s surplus or deficit. The Directors also ensure that the Bank keeps proper accounting records that disclose, with reasonable accuracy, the financial position of the Bank. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Bank.
 
The Directors accept responsibility for the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements whether due to fraud or error. They also accept responsibility for:
 
(i)    Designing, implementing and maintaining internal control necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error;
 
(ii)   Selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and
 
(iii)  Making accounting estimates and judgments that are reasonable in the circumstances.
 
The Directors are of the opinion that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the financial position of the Bank at 30 June 2014 and of the Bank’s financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Central Bank of Kenya Act.
Nothing has come to the attention of the Directors to indicate that the Bank and its subsidiary will not remain a going concern for at least twelve months from the date of this statement.
Approved by the Board of Directors and signed on its behalf by:

REPORT OF THE AUDITOR-GENERAL ON CENTRAL BANK OF KENYA FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30TH JUNE, 2014
 
REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT
The accompanying financial statements of Central Bank of Kenya set out on pages 11to 47, which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30th June, 2014, and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year the ended and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information have been audited on my behalf by Pricewaterhouse Coopers, auditors appointed under Section 39 of the Public Audit Act, 2003 and in accordance with the provisions of Article 229 of the Constitution of Kenya. The auditors have duly reported to me the results of their audit and on the basis of their report, I am satisfied that all the information and explanations which to the best of my knowledge and belief, were necessary for the purpose of the audit were obtained.
Directors’ Responsibility for the Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and for such internal control as Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.
The Directors are also responsible for the submission of the financial statements to the Auditor-General in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Public Audit Act, 2003.
Auditor-General’s Responsibility
My responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on the audit and report in accordance with the provisions of Section 15 (2) of the Public Audit Act, 2003 and submit the audit report in compliance with Article 229 (7) of the Constitution of Kenya. The Audit was conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require compliance with ethical requirements and that the audit be planned and performed to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonabless of accounting estimates made by the Directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial  statements.
I believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.
Opinion
In my opinion the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Bank as at 30th June, 2014, and its financial performance and its cashflows for the year then ended, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and comply with the Central Bank Act, Cap. 491 of the Laws of Kenya.

Notes
 

1


General information


 


 


 


Central Bank of Kenya (the “Bank”) is established by and derives its authority and accountability from the Central Bank of Kenya Act Cap 491 of the Laws of Kenya (the “CBK Act”). The Bank is wholly owned by the Government of Kenya and is domiciled in Kenya. The Bank acts as banker, advisor and agent of the Government of Kenya.


 


 


2


Summary of significant accounting policies


 


 


 


The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.


 


 


(a)


Basis of preparation


 


 


 


The financial statements are prepared in compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).  The measurement basis applied is the historical cost basis, except where otherwise stated in the accounting policies below.  The financial statements are presented in Kenya Shillings (Shs), rounded to the nearest million.


 


 


 


Changes in accounting policy and disclosures


 


 


 


(i) New and amended standards adopted by the Bank


 


 


 


IAS 19, ‘Employee benefits’ was amended in June 2011. The amendments to IAS 19 effective for periods starting on or after 1 January 2013 have been applied by the Bank for the first time. The revised standard requires that all actuarial gains and losses arising in any given year be recognised immediately in Other Comprehensive Income.  Previously actuarial gains and losses outside the 10% corridor were deferred and amortised over the expected working life of employees.
 
The largest impact of the adoption has been an increase in the pension asset relating to unrecognized actuarial gains posted to Other Comprehensive Income as a prior year adjustment.  This has led to increase in 1 July 2013 opening reserves by Shs 5,141 million. Additional disclosures have been made in the financial statements in accordance with the revised standard in note 17 to the financial statements. The retrospective effect of the standard has been incorporated on the financial statements, including the inclusion of a third column in the statement of financial position relating to the restated position at 30 June 2012, in accordance with IFRS requirements.


 


 


 


IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’, aims to improve consistency and reduce complexity by providing a precise definition of fair value and a single source of fair value measurement and disclosure requirements for use across IFRSs. The requirements, which are largely aligned between IFRSs and US GAAP, do not extend the use of fair value accounting but provide guidance on how it should be applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards within IFRSs or US GAAP. The application of IFRS 13 has resulted in enhanced fair value disclosures in the financial statements and has impacted the disclosures under note 29.


 


 


 


IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’ - is a new standard that replaces the consolidation requirements in SIC-12 Consolidation—Special Purpose Entities and IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements. The standard builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated financial statements of the parent company and provides additional guidance to assist in the determination of control where this is difficult to assess.
 
The revised definition of control focuses on the need to have both power and variable returns before control is present.  The Bank has only one subsidiary, Kenya School of Monetary Studies, for which it has 99% ownership. The Directors are satisfied that ownership of the entity meets the revised definition of control.


 


 


 


There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on 1 July 2013 that would be expected to have a material impact on the Bank.


 


(ii) Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Bank


 


 


 


A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 July 2013, and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. None of these is expected to have a significant effect on the financial statements of the Bank, except the following:


 


 


 


IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. Issued in November 2009 and October 2011, it replaces the parts of IAS 39 that relate to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into two measurement categories: those measured as at fair value and those measured at amortised cost. The determination is made at initial recognition. The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing its financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument. For financial liabilities, the standard retains most of the IAS 39 requirements. The main change is that, in cases where the fair value option is taken for financial liabilities, the part of a fair value change due to an entity’s own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch. The Directors are yet to assess IFRS 9’s full impact and intend to adopt IFRS 9 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2015.


 


 


 


Amendments to IAS 32 titled Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (issued in December 2011) – The amendments address inconsistencies in current practice when applying the offsetting criteria in IAS 32, mainly by clarifying the meaning of “currently has a legally enforceable right of set-off” and that some gross settlement systems may be considered equivalent to net settlement. They are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, with retrospective application.


 


 


 


Amendments to IAS 36 titled Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets (issued in May 2013) – The amendments reduce the circumstances in which the recoverable amount of assets or cash-generating units is required to be disclosed, clarify the disclosures required, and introduce an explicit requirement to disclose the discount rate used in determining impairment (or reversals) where recoverable amount (based on fair value less costs of disposal) is determined using a present value technique. They are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. Amendments to IAS 39 titled Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting (issued in June 2013) – The amendments permit the continuation of hedge accounting in a situation where the counterparty to a derivative designated as a hedging instrument is replaced by a new central counterparty (known as ‘novation of derivatives’), as a consequence of laws or regulations, if specific conditions are met. They are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.


 


 


 


Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 titled Investment Entities (issued in October 2012) – The amendments define “investment entities” and provide them an exemption from the consolidation of subsidiaries; instead, an investment entity is required to measure the investment in each eligible subsidiary at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9 / IAS 39 (the exception does not apply to subsidiaries that provide services relating to the investment entity’s investment activities). An investment entity is required to account for its investment in a relevant subsidiary in the same way in its consolidated and separate financial statements, and additional disclosures are introduced. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, retrospectively with some transitional provisions. The Directors do not anticipate any effect on the Bank’s financial statements as the Bank is not an investment entity.


 


 


 


IFRIC 21 Levies (issued in May 2013) – The interpretation provides guidance on when to recognise a liability for a levy imposed by a government. The obligating event for the recognition of a liability is the activity that triggers the payment of the levy in accordance with the relevant legislation. It also provides guidance on recognition of a liability to pay levies: the liability is recognised either progressively if the obligating event occurs over a period of time, or when the minimum threshold is reached if an obligation is triggered on reaching that minimum threshold. The interpretation is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014


(b)


Consolidation


 


 


 


Kenya School of Monetary Studies is a subsidiary to the Bank. The Bank has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Bank. 


 


 


 


The group uses the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the group. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date.


 


 


 


The excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the
Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in profit or loss. Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group entities are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Bank.


(c)


Functional currency and translation of foreign currencies


 


i. Functional and presentation currency


 


Items included in the financial are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Bank operates (the “Functional Currency”). The financial statements are presented in Kenya Shillings (“Shs”) which is the Bank’s Functional Currency.


 


ii. Transactions and balances


 


 


 


Foreign currency transactions are translated into the Functional Currency using exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. All foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in profit or loss within ‘foreign exchange gains/(losses)’.


(d)


Sale and repurchase agreements


 


 


 


Securities sold subject to repurchase agreements (“repos”) are reclassified in the financial statements as pledged assets when the transferee has the right by contract or custom to sell or repledge the collateral; the counterparty liability is included in investments by banks.
 
Securities purchased under agreements to resell (“reverse repos”) are recorded as advances to banks. The difference between sale and repurchase price is treated as interest and accrued over the life of the agreements using the effective interest method. Securities lent to counterparties are also retained in the financial statements.
 
The Bank from time to time mops up money from the financial market (“repos”) or injects money into the market (“reverse repos”) with maturities of 4-7 days. The Bank engages in these transactions with commercial banks only. These have been disclosed in the financial statements as ‘advances to banks’ and ‘investments by banks’.


(e)


Financial assets and liabilities


 


 


 


i.      Financial assets


 


 


 


The Bank classifies its financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity and available-for-sale financial assets. The Directors determine the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. The Bank uses trade date accounting for regular way contracts when recording financial asset transactions.


 


 


 


Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss


 


 


 


This category comprises two sub-categories: financial assets classified as held for trading, and financial assets designated by the Bank as at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition.
 
A financial asset is classified as held for trading if it is acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing it in the near term or if it is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking.


 


 


 


Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are designated and effective as hedging instruments. All derivatives are carried as assets when fair value is positive and as liabilities when fair value is negative.
 
The Bank designates certain financial assets upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss (fair value option). This designation cannot subsequently be changed and can only be applied when the following conditions are met:
 
the application of the fair value option reduces or eliminates an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise or
the financial assets are part of a portfolio of financial instruments which is risk managed and reported to senior management on a fair value basis or
the financial assets consist of debt host and embedded derivatives that must be separated.

 
Financial instruments included in this category are recognised initially at fair value; transaction costs are taken directly to profit or loss. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included directly in profit or loss and are reported as ‘fair value loss on financial assets held for trading '. Interest income and expense and dividend income and expenses on financial assets held for trading are included in ‘interest income' and ‘interest expense’ respectively.


 


 


 


Loans and receivables


 


 


 


Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value – which is the cash consideration to originate or purchase the loan including any transaction costs – and measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.


 


 


 


The Bank operates a staff loans scheme for its employees for the provision of facilities such as house and car loans. The loans are granted to staff at an interest rate of 3% per annum which is generally below the prevailing market interest rates. Loans issued at non market rates are initially measured at fair value (by discounting the related cash flows using market rates of interest) and subsequently carried at amortised cost. The difference between the fair value of the loans and the carrying amount at inception is treated as a long term employee benefit and is accounted for as a deferred cost. The resulting loan adjustment account is released to interest income over the loan period in line with the unwinding of the discount, while the deferred cost is expensed to staff costs as the services are rendered to the Bank over the period of the loan.


 


Available-for-sale financial assets


 


 


 


Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless the investment matures or management intends to dispose of it within 12 months of the end of the reporting period. Available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value. Gains or losses arising from fair value remeasurements are included in other comprehensive income.


 


 


 


ii.                     Financial liabilities


 


 


 


The Bank’s holding in financial liabilities represents mainly deposits from banks and government and other liabilities. Such financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.


 


 


 


 


 


Cash Reserve Ratio are statutory deposits taken from commercial banks and non-bank financial institutions for liquidity management as part of monetary policies in accordance with the Kenyan Banking Act and are interest free.


 


 


 


iii.                    Determination of fair value


 


 


 


For financial instruments traded in active markets, the determination of fair values of financial instruments is based on quoted market prices or dealer price quotations. This includes listed equity securities and quoted debt instruments on major exchanges and broker quotes from Bloomberg.
 
A financial instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. If the above criteria are not met, the market is regarded as being inactive. Indicators that a market is inactive are when there is a wide bid-offer spread or significant increase in the bid-offer spread or there are few recent transactions.


 


For all other financial instruments, fair value is determined using valuation techniques. In these techniques, fair values are estimated from observable data in respect of similar financial instruments, using models to estimate the present value of expected future cash flows or other valuation techniques, using inputs.


 


                                                                              


 


In cases when the fair value of unlisted equity instruments cannot be determined reliably, the instruments are carried at cost less impairment. The fair values of contingent liabilities and irrevocable loan commitments correspond to their carrying amounts.


 


 


 


iv.                     De-recognition


 


 


 


Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to receive the cash flows from these assets have ceased to exist or the assets have been transferred and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets are also transferred (that is, if substantially all the risks and rewards have not been transferred, the Bank tests control to ensure that continuing involvement on the basis of any retained powers of control does not prevent derecognition). Financial liabilities are derecognised when they have been redeemed or otherwise extinguished.

vi.           Impairment of financial assets


 


 


 


a.    Loans and receivables


 


The Bank assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial instrument’s original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in profit or loss. A loan is normally written off, either partially or in full, when there is no realistic prospect of recovery of the principal amount, and for a collateralised loan, after taking into account any value of the security which has been realised.  


 


b.  Available for sale financial assets


 


 


 


The Bank assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss, the cumulative loss – measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss – is removed from equity and recognised in profit or loss.


 


 


 


If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss, the impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.


 


 


 


If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets, impairment losses recognised in profit or loss on equity instruments are not reversed through profit or loss.


 


 


 


vii.           Offsetting financial instruments


 


 


 


Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.


 


 


(f)


f. Cash and cash equivalents


 


 


 


Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.


(g)


g. Property and equipment


 


 


 


Land and buildings comprise mainly branches and offices. All equipment used by the Bank is stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Land and buildings are stated at valuation less accumulated depreciation. Valuations are carried out every three years.
 
Subsequent expenditures are included in the asset’s carrying amount or are recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Bank and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is de-recognised. All other repair and maintenance costs are charged to profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation of other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost or revalued amounts to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:


 


Leasehold land


Over the period of the lease


 


Buildings


20 years


 


Motor vehicles


4 years


 


Furniture and equipment


5 - 10 years


 


 


 


The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are included in ‘other income’ in profit or loss. When revalued assets are sold, the amounts included in other reserves are transferred to the general reserve.


(h)


Intangible assets


 


 


 


Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Bank are recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:


 


 
i.  it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use;
ii. management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it;
there is an ability to use or sell the software product;
it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits;
adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software product are available; and
iii. the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.


 


 


 


Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software product include the software development employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads.
 
Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
 
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which does not exceed three years.
 
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. These costs are amortised on the basis of the expected useful lives. Software has a maximum expected useful life of 5 years.


 


 


(i)


Impairment of non-financial assets


 


 


 


Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). The impairment test also can be performed on a single asset when the fair value less cost to sell or the value in use can be determined reliably. Non-financial assets that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.


(j)


Employee benefits


 


 


 


The Bank operates a defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes. The schemes are funded through payments to trustee-administered funds on a monthly basis.


 


 


 


On the defined contribution scheme, the Bank pays fixed contributions to the scheme. The payments are charged to the profit or loss in the year to which they relate. The Bank has no further payment obligation once the contributions have been paid.


 


The defined benefit plan defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, dependent on age, years of service and compensation.


 


 


 


The assets of the scheme are held by the Bank in an independent trustee administered fund. The asset recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme is the fair value of the scheme’s assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by an independent actuary using the projected unit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated cash outflows using interest rates of Kenya treasury bonds that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.


 


 


 


See note 2 (a) (i) on adoption of IAS 19 Employee benefits (Revised).


 


 


 


The Bank and all its employees contribute to the National Social Security Fund, which is a defined contribution scheme.
 
A defined contribution scheme is a retirement benefit plan under which the Bank pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Bank has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
 
The Bank’s contributions to the defined contribution scheme are charged to the profit or loss account in the year in which they fall due.


 


 


 


The estimated monetary liability for employees’ accrued annual leave entitlement at the reporting date is recognised as an expense accrual.


 


 


(k)


Income tax


 


 


 


Section 7 of the Income Tax Act exempts the Bank from any taxation imposed by law in respect of income or profits. This exemption includes stamp duty in respect of instruments executed by or on behalf of the Bank.


(l)


Provisions


 


 


 


Provisions are recognised when: the Bank has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
 
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.
 
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation at a rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.


 


 


(m)


Share capital


 


 


 


Ordinary shares are classified as ‘share capital’ in equity.


 


 


(n)


Dividend payable


 


 


 


The Central Bank of Kenya Act (Cap 491) allows the Bank to retain at least 10% of realized income after taking into account expenses. In addition to this, the Board of Directors in the year 2007 set a policy that all dividends shall be net of unrealized income and other revaluations gains in addition to the retention allowed by the Act.


 


 


 


Dividends on ordinary shares are charged to equity in the period in which they are declared.


 


 


(o)


Leases


 


 


 


Bank as lessee
 
The leases entered into by the Bank are primarily operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.


 


 


 


Bank as lessor
 
The group leases certain property and equipment where it does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the assets. The operating leases generate rental income which is recorded in the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.


 


 


(p)


Interest income and expense


 


 


 


Interest income and expense for all interest-bearing financial instruments are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.


 


The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability on initial recognition. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Bank estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, and any revisions to these estimates are recognised in the income statement. The calculation includes amounts paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate of a financial instrument, including transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts.


(q)


Fee and commission income


 


 


 


Fees and commissions are generally recognised on an accrual basis when the service has been provided.
 
The Bank earns from the Government a commission of 1.5% of amounts raised through its agency role in the issuance of Treasury bills and bonds. The annual commission income is limited to Shs 3 billion as per the agreement between the Bank and Treasury effective 1 July 2007. In addition, the Bank earns commissions from other debt instruments issued to meet funding requirements of State Corporations.


 


 


(r)


Commitments on behalf of the Kenya Government and National Treasury


 


 


 


The Bank issues Treasury Bonds and Bills on behalf of the National Treasury. Commitments arising on such transactions on behalf of Kenya Government and National Treasury are not included in these financial statements as the Bank is involved in such transactions only as agent.


 


 


(s)


Currency in circulation


 


 


 


Notes and coins in circulation are measured at cost. Currency in circulation represents the nominal value of all bank notes and coins held by the public and commercial banks.


 


 


(t)


Currency printing and minting costs


 


 


 


The cost of unissued bank note stocks is recognised in the statement of financial position as deferred currency costs under ‘other assets’.


 


 


 


The estimate of the useful lives of various bank notes denominations was changed in the year. The useful life of the various bank note denominations was previously estimated as follows:


 


 


 


Shs 1,000                                2 years
Shs 500                  2 years
Shs 200                  2 years
All other denominations      1 year
 
Bank note costs are now charged to profit or loss in the year in which the bank notes are issued. The impact of the change in estimate has been the write-off of Shs 1,254 million relating to un-armotised costs of bank notes in issue at 30 June 2014.
 
There has been no change in accounting for coin minting costs which are charged to profit or loss when delivered and the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Bank.


 


 


(u)


Loan due from the Government of Kenya


 


 


 


The loan due from the Government of Kenya arose from overdrawn accounts which were converted to a loan with effect from 1 July 1997 after an amendment to the Central Bank of Kenya Act to limit the Bank’s lending to Government of Kenya to 5% of Government of Kenya audited revenue.
 
On 24 July 2007, a deed of guarantee was signed between the Government of Kenya and Central Bank of Kenya in which the Government agreed to repay the loan at Shs 1.1 billion per annum over 32 years at 3% interest per annum. The security held is lien over cash balances, stock, treasury bonds and such other government securities as are specified in Section 46(5) of the Central Bank of Kenya Act.
 
The loan due from the Government of Kenya is categorised as a loan and receivables and is measured at amortised cost.


(v)


Funds held at/ due to International Monetary Fund (IMF)


 


 


 


Kenya has been a member of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) since 1966. The Bank is the designated depository for the IMF’s holdings of Kenya’s currency.  IMF currency holdings are held in the No. 1 and No. 2 Accounts, which are deposit accounts of the IMF with the Bank.
 
Borrowings from and repayments to the IMF are denominated in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). The SDR balances in IMF accounts are translated into Shillings at the prevailing exchange rates and any unrealized gains or losses are accounted for in accordance with accounting policy on foreign currencies.
 
On a custodial basis, the Bank holds a non-negotiable, non-interest bearing and encashable on demand security issued by the Treasury in favour of the IMF in its capacity as the IMF’s depository. The security issued is in part payment of Kenya’s quota of IMF shares.


 


 


(w)


Comparatives


 


 


 


Where necessary, comparative figures have been adjusted to conform to changes in presentation in the current year.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies


 


 


 


(a) Critical estimates in applying the entity’s accounting policies


 


 


 


The Bank makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.


 


 


 


i.      Post-retirement benefits


 


 


 


Post-retirement benefits are long term liabilities whose value can only be estimated using assumptions about developments over a long period. The Bank has employed actuarial advice in arriving at the figures in the financial statements (Note 18 which includes assumptions). The Board of Directors considers the assumptions used by the actuary in their calculations to be appropriate for this purpose.


 


ii.     Loans and advances


 


 


 


Critical estimates are made by the management in determining the recoverable amount of impaired loans and receivables.


 


 


 


iii.   Fair value of financial assets


 


 


 


The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market and off market loans are determined by using valuation techniques.


 


 


 


iv.       Property and equipment


 


 


 


Land and buildings are carried at fair value; representing open market value determined periodically by internal professional valuers.


 


(b) Critical judgements in applying the entity’s accounting policies


 


 


 


In the process of applying the Bank’s accounting policies, management has made judgements in determining:
the classification of financial assets and leases
whether assets are impaired.

In exceptional circumstances, as allowed by Section 36 of the Act, the Bank may act as the “lender of last resort” to financial institutions in difficulty. Commercial banks did not utilise this facility in the year under review (2013: Nil). The overnight lending attracts an interest at the CBR rate plus a margin determined by the Bank.

Land and buildings were revalued by internal professional valuers in 2012 on an open market basis and the revaluation has been included in the revaluation reserve. The next valuation is due in 2015 in accordance with the Bank’s policy.
 
Land and buildings are included in the level 2 of the fair valuation hierarchy (that is, the fair value is based on inputs other than quoted prices that are observable).The methods and significant assumptions applied in arriving at the revalued amounts are as follows:
 
The Bank’s residential properties are all owner-occupied. In carrying out the valuation, the Bank has assumed that the prospective rental income to be generated by the property based on the going rentals for similar properties within the same location.
 
The Bank has taken into account comparables values of similar properties (plot, construction standards, design, (lay out), size,   location, – current sale   prices of vacant plots and those developed) to derive the market prices. These were obtained from market transactions of comparable properties.
 
Included in land and buildings is land in Kisumu and Mombasa valued at Shs. 486 million, for which the bank is in the final stage of registration of titles. All the necessary documentation to facilitate the titles preparation has been completed and the leases are awaiting signature. The Bank is in possession and occupies all the properties. The Directors expect this process to be completed in the next 12 months from the date of these financial statements.

Financial risk management objectives and policies


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


The Bank’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including credit risk and the effects of changes in debt and equity market prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Bank’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on its financial performance.
 
Risk management is carried out by the Financial Markets Department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Other organs that monitor the assessment and management of risks within the Bank include: Board Audit Committee, Internal Audit Department and Risk Management Unit.

 
(a)     Strategy in using financial instruments 
 
The Bank holds foreign exchange reserves for the purposes of servicing official foreign debt, paying non-government debt and Central Bank of Kenya expenditures abroad, and occasional intervention in the foreign exchange market to smoothen exchange rate volatilities.  The Bank can only intervene in the foreign exchange market when there are sharp exchange rate movements which are likely to destabilize the financial market.
 
Governed by the Bank’s reserve management policy of safe investment, liquidity and return, respectively, the Bank, with a prudent approach, subjects its foreign exchange reserves to investments in international markets.
 
In this framework, almost all the financial risks to which the Bank is exposed arise while fulfilling its duties of managing foreign exchange reserves and rendering certain banking services to the banking sector and the Government of the Republic of Kenya.
 
The Bank is exposed to credit, market and liquidity risks due to the aforementioned operations. The financial risks that arise during the management of foreign exchange reserves are the outcome of an investment choice. Nevertheless, the Bank endeavours to minimize such risks by managing them with a conservative approach.
 
Foreign exchange reserves are managed by observing the investment criteria defined in the Bank’s Guidelines on Foreign Exchange Reserves Management.
 
(b) Risks facing the Bank
 
The following are the main types of risks that the Bank is exposed to in the course of executing its operations:

 


Financial risks include:
 
-         Credit risk
-         Market risk:
Interest risk
Foreign currency exchange risk
-         Liquidity risk


Non-financial risks include:
 
-         Operational risk
-         Human resource risk
-         Legal risk
-         Reputation risk
 


 


 

 
i. Credit risk
 
Credit risk arises from investment securities, balances due from banking institutions, funds held with IMF, loans and advances as well as other assets. The Bank has no significant concentrations of credit risk except for the lending to the Government of Kenya.
 
Management of the credit risk is through the choice of depository banks. The Bank’s choice of depository banks is confined to top international banks that meet the set eligibility criteria of financial soundness on long-term credit rating (A), short-term credit rating (AA), composite rating and capital adequacy.
 
The amount that best represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is per the statement of financial position.
 
The Bank does not grade the credit quality of these assets. None of the balances have had their terms renegotiated. Management monitors the credit exposure of staff on a continuous basis, taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors. Provisions of Shs 104 million (2013: Shs 83 million) have been recorded due to impaired balances to related parties.
 
The following amounts in loans and advances and other assets are neither past due nor impaired or individually impaired. All other financial instruments operate within their contractual terms.

There were no past due but not impaired balances as at 30 June 2014 (2013: Nil).
ii. Market risk
The Bank takes on exposure to market risks, which is the risk that fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risks arise from open positions in interest rate, currency and equity, all of which are exposed to general and specific market movements and changes in the level of volatility of market rates or prices such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. The Bank separates exposures to market risk into either trading or non-trading portfolios.
Market risks arising from trading and non-trading activities are concentrated in Bank Treasury and are monitored by management through guidelines from the Foreign Reserves Investments Committee (FRIC) with oversight from the Financial Stability Committee.
Trading portfolios include those positions arising from market-making transactions where the Bank acts as principal with commercial banks or the market.
Non-trading portfolios primarily arise from the interest rate management of the Bank’s investments and monetary policy assets and liabilities. Non-trading portfolios also consist of foreign exchange and equity risks arising from the Bank’s held-to-maturity and World Bank RAMP financial assets.
Interest rate risk

The Bank’s interest rate risk arises from interest bearing investments, loans and advances to commercial banks and investments by banks. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Bank to cash flow interest rate risk which is partially offset by cash held at variable rates. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Bank to fair value interest rate risk.
The tables below summarise the Bank’s financial assets and liabilities and analyses them into the earlier of contractual maturity or repricing.

As at 30 June 2014, an increase/decrease of 10 basis points would have resulted in a decrease/increase in surplus of Shs 762 million (2013: Shs 700 million).
        

 


Foreign currency exchange risk


 


 


 


The Bank takes on exposure to the effects of fluctuations in the prevailing foreign currency exchange rates on its financial position and cash flows. The Foreign Reserves Investments Committee (FRIC) sets limits on the level of exposure by currency which is monitored daily.

As at 30 June 2014, if the shilling had weakened/strengthened by 5% against the major currencies with all other variables held constant, the impact on the Bank’s surplus would have been:
USD Shs 27,328 million (2013: Shs 18,991 million)
Euro Shs 2,601 million (2013: Shs 1,625 million)
British Pound Shs 4,931 million (2013: Shs 4,106 million)
SDR Shs 6,469 million (2013: Shs 5,794 million)
 
iii. Liquidity risk
 
Prudent liquidity risk management includes maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, and the availability of funding from an adequate amount of committed credit facilities. Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Treasury maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under committed credit lines.
 
Management monitors rolling forecasts of the Bank’s liquidity reserve on the basis of expected cash flow.
 
The table below analyses the Bank’s financial liabilities that will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the statement of financial position date to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the table below are the contractual undiscounted cash flows. Balances due within 12 months equal their carrying balances, as the impact of discounting is not significant.

Fair value of financial instruments
 
IFRS 7 specifies a fair value hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources; unobservable inputs reflect the Bank's market assumptions. These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy:
 
Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. This level includes listed equity securities and debt instruments on exchanges (for example, Bloomberg).
 
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices). The sources of input parameters like LIBOR yield curve or counterparty credit risk are Bloomberg.
 
Level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). This level includes equity investments and debt instruments with significant unobservable components.
