PURSUANT to regulation 21 of Environmental (Impact Assessment and Audit) Regulations, the National Environment Management Authority, (NEMA) has received an environmental impact assessment study report for the implementation of the proposed subdivision of Konza ranch.
The proposed project involves subdivision of the 17,479 acres Konza ranch into agricultural, commercial and utilities parcels. The project will end up with 3,751 acres commercial plots and 17,479 acres residential plots.

River valleys, steep hills will be declared public areas and not allocated to individuals.
Bush clearance to be limited only to areas earmarked for cultivation.
Use cultivation methods that protect the soil such as contour ploughing in sloppy areas.
Sensitise members on the dangers of overstocking and why they must respect the carrying capacity of the land.
Re- vegetate previously degraded areas wherever possible.


Possible Impacts


Mitigation measures


Flora and fauna


Work only according to the survey briefs.
Surveyor to Endeavour to access only areas where beacons are to be placed.
Avoid allocating sensitive ecological areas to individuals.


Changes in hydrology/ impended drainage


Avoid allocating to members river valleys, steep hill sides and identified wetlands.
Ensure efficiency of drainage structures through proper design and maintenance.

Sensitise members on the dangers of overstocking and why they must respect the carrying capacity of the land.
Sensitise members on the advantages of planting drought resistant food crops.


Loss of wildlife habitat


Set aside ecologically sensitive areas as nature conservation blocks within the ranch.
Partner with Government Agencies and NGO’s to come up with best ways of managing the animals within the community.
Sensitise the members on the importance of conserving our wildlife.
Partner with KWS to relocate the cheetahs to designated game reserves as they are an endangered species.
Partner with KWS to relocate unmanageable game to designated parks.


Fragmentation of land to uneconomical units


Rigorously Enforce the zoning laws.
Set minimum sizes for parcels in agricultural zones.


Aesthetic loss


Avoid vegetation clearance on hilltops, valleys.
Preserve all mature trees as much as is practical.
