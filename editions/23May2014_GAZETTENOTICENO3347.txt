ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY REPORT FOR THE PROPOSED ALUMINIUM BEVERAGE CAN FACTORY ON PLOT LR NO. KJD/ KAPUTIEI-SOUTH/ 3875, ENORETET VILLAGE WITHIN SULTAN HAMUD AREA OF NKAMA LOCATION, KENYEWA DIVISION OF MASHURU SUB- COUNTY IN KAJIADO COUNTY
INVITATION OF PUBLIC COMMENTS
PURSUANT to regulation 21 of the Environmental Management and Co-ordination (Impact Assessment and Audit) Regulations, 2003, the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) has received an Environmental Impact Assessment Study Report for the above proposed project.
The Proponent (GZ Industries Kenya Limited) is proposing to set up an Aluminium Beverage Can Factory on Plot LR No. KJD/ KAPUTIEI-SOUTH/ 3875, about 6 kilometres past Sultan Hamud Town in Enoretet Village within Sultan Hamud area of Nkama Location, Kenyewa Division of Mashuru Sub- County in Kajiado County
The project will encompass the following: production / factory plant, accommodation and recreational facilities; a dinning/ kitchen facilities, an office block, changing rooms, clinic, gate houses, road works and storm water drainage facilities, perimeter wall / fence, external service utility areas (diesel storage, LPG storage, compressor/ vacuum pumps, cooling towers etc.), external walkways and landscaping, waste water treatment facility.
The following are the anticipated impacts and proposed mitigation measures:

Impacts


Mitigation Measures


Soil erosion


Proper planning of site clearing or disturbance of the natural vegetation.
Isolated sites with installations and frequent human presence that require re-vegetation will be surrounded by less palatable native species to act as plant screens and make less attractive to foraging wildlife.
Wash areas shall be placed and constructed in such a manner so as to ensure that the surrounding areas (including groundwater) are not polluted.


Air quality


Provide personnel with Personal Protective Equipment & Clothing (PPE&C) such as dust masks, boots among others. Mechanism should be put in place to ensure PPE&C are specific for the activities at hand and are always worn within the project sites;
The stockpiles of earth generated during construction works, unpaved access roads and areas used for handling fine construction materials should be palliated with water regularly in order to suppressed evolution of particles;
All machinery and equipment should be maintained in good working condition in order to minimise emissions to acceptable standards;
Train construction and delivery trucks drivers on pre-cautionary measures that enable curb emissions for example advise on techniques to reduce dust evolution especially when driving in areas of dense human settlement or nearing the project site to avoid creating dusty conditions; techniques to conserve fuel and reduce emission by switching off the engines when vehicles are idling;
Construction trucks delivering materials to site should be covered in order to minimise spread of fugitive emissions to the surrounding areas;
No burning of materials should be permitted at the project site;
Use clean energy to fuel project vehicles, equipments and machines in order to reduce air pollutants


Risk of leaks and spill


Conduct regular maintenance of site equipment and machinery to ensure leakages are controlled or detected early;
Project vehicles and equipment should be serviced according to manufacturer’s requirements to limit release of exhaust emissions;
Investigate the possibility of fitting catalytic converters in machines with engines so as to convert harmful substance in the exhaust fumes to less harmful substances;
Safety procedures for fuel storage and re-fuelling should be well understood and implemented by site staff; and oil residuals including waste oil,lubricants, used filters, should be carefully collected and stored for safe disposal, in order to prevent spillover effects of contaminant hydrocarbons into storm water or groundwater resources;
Protect project area from fire by posting warning signs in area where hydrocarbon fuels are used;
Observe the requirements of the emission control regulations


Occupational health and safety issues


Ensure the working hours are controlled and that employees are not allowed to extend the working hours beyond an acceptable limit for purposes of gaining extra pay;
Ensure that all construction works close to existing infrastructure is supervised from the relevant authorities to guide activities such as excavation near the oil pipeline and railway line;
Ensure that ALL requirements as stated by KPC approval are adhered to at all phases of the project development;
Educate community, visitors and employees (both direct and indirect) against interfering with KPC infrastructure for example pipelines; and
Ensure appropriate road safety signages are strategically placed and drivers adhere to the requirements of such signage;
Erect speed breaks where human and vehicular traffic have high interaction opportunities;
Avoid activities likely to activate mudslides or rockfalls when working in steep areas for example avoid pouring excess water in muddy areas or steep slopes with soil; and


Noise and vibration


Conduct periodic noise measuring and monitoring to determine levels and extent of harmful noise;
Clearly label the high noise areas.
Provide PPE (hearing protection) to persons operating within or visit identified high noise areas;
In order to meet noise level requirements, the works equipments should be equipped with standard noise attenuation features. Machines that exceed acceptable noise limits should be equipped with silencers or lagging materials or specially designed acoustic enclosures;
Inform local residents when construction activities are likely to generate excessive noise in order to minimize disruption to local residents;
Sensitise truck drivers to switch off engines while offloading materials; to avoid gunning vehicle engines or hooting especially when passing through sensitive areas such as churches, schools, residential areas and hospitals.


Pollution


The management should ensure that solid waste is collected in a centrally placed area and the person responsible for collecting the waste is licensed by NEMA and the County Government of Kajiado to collect and dispose of waste.
The management should ensure that liquid waste from the proposed site is directed to the appropriate drains to the proposed waste water treatment works and further back to the natural water drains from Mashuru hills (to the south west of the proposed project site).


Traffic Management


The management team should seek relevant approvals from the Ministry of Roads/ Kenya National Highways Authority (KENHA) who may then advice on the creation of an access entrance so as to reduce traffic congestion on the main highway;
The management should assign personnel to be in charge of traffic within the property/ factory premises in order to avoid traffic congestion within the property;
The possibility of communal modes of transport for employees should be explored.


Fire Management


Construct a band wall between the factory perimeter and the KPC oil pipe line to the north east of the proposed plot- to protect both the GZ Industries facilities and the KPC oil pipeline incase of a fire incident or accident;
Ensure that all persons on site where anti-static footwear and clothing to avoid any static ingnition;
Place portable fire extinguishers at suitable locations, according to the activities in the operation programme in conformity with the Factories and other Places of Work (Fire Risk Reduction) Rules, 2007;
Development of fire emergency procedures and pinning them up in a place where all workers can access them;
Training all staff on fire safety policy and procedures;
Allocating a fire assembly point;


Loss of livelihood


Provide earlier notice to all affected parties concerning the development;
Dismissal procedures should be compliant with the Employment Act, 2007;
Residence to be notified prior to any decommissioning of the proposed factory buildings and any other facility on site.
