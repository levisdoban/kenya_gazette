Environmental  and Social impacts


Mitigation measure


Loss of biodiversity

-Clearance of vegetation should be done in necessary areas only.
-Carry out environmental compensation where harm cannot be avoided by planting of indigenous plants.


Soil Degradation


-Use of gravel bags to trap sediment.
-Rocked construction entrance and exit  to keep sediment from being tracked onto adjacent roads and keep vehicles off bare soils.
-Stock piles to be covered with tarpaulin.
-Excavated soil to be used for back filling.
-Top soil to be used for landscaping.
-Limit the use of heavy machinery at the site & control earth works.


Air pollution


-Spray water on exposed areas during dry weather to suppress dust.
