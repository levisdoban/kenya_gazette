Preface
This report covers the period between July and December, 2013, a time of transition in the history of the County and the Nation in general. Indeed, the promulgation of the new constitution ushered in a new era in the governance of the Republic of Kenya. One key change introduced by this dawn was devolution. Following the passage of the constitution, several Laws have been passed by the national assembly, as envisaged by the same constitution, to actualize and implement it including rolling out devolution. Some of the Laws operationalizing devolution include the County Government Act 2012, the Transition to County Government Act and the Transition Act.
On the 4th of March 2013, devolution became a reality to Kenya when Kenyans, through the ballot, voted for their first leaders under the devolved system of government. Since then, the County governments were established and first Governors sworn in. Subsequently, other organs and institutions that will deliver functions to this government were then sworn in. One such institution is the County Public Service Board.  Elgeyo Marakwet County Public Service Board came into existence on 25th June 2013, when its members were sworn in. This report covers the period from then to 31st December 2013.
As one of the organs responsible for the transition into a new government, the EMC-CPSB has taken this role with speed and diligence. As detailed in this report, the board has been instrumental in selection of chief-officers, filling positions in the County organization structure, delivering an HR planning strategy to the county, developing a board charter, establishing and adopting terms of reference for digital system for recruitment, selection and performance management. The board has also established structures and frameworks that will enable the county have an efficient and vibrant public service that is capable of service to its citizens.
As we embarked on establishing our county structures, it has not been without challenges. As at the close of 2013, the EMC CPSB did not have a budget, offices nor a secretariat.
The County Public Service Board has worked with the County Executive and the County Assembly through the CASB on several frontiers. We report that the task has been both challenging and exciting. We have shepherded and lived up to the values as enriched in the constitution, and we are continuously committed to ensuring that we have put in place structures to safeguard the constitution and all other Laws of the land.
Yours Sincerely,
GIDEON KIPYAKWAI
Chairman, CPSB

Statement from the Board Secretary
 
Elgeyo Marakwet County Public Service Board was established under Chapter 13 Article 235 of the Constitution of Kenya 2010 and section 57 of the County Government Act of 2012. It consists of the chairman, Vice-chairman and four other members appointed by the Governor with the approval of the County Assembly. The Board is required under Article 59 (1) (d) to prepare regular reports for Submission to the County Assembly on the execution of the functions of the Board. This introduces an accountability framework on the discharge of the Board’s mandate.
Upon its inauguration, the Board started discharging its mandate. Since then, the bulk of the Board’s activities have entailed setting up modalities to enable it discharge its mandate. To this end, the Board formulated its Charter, came up with its Vision, Mission, slogan and Core Values, and designed the Structure of the Secretariat which is expected to be filled in the coming year. To build the capacity of Board members, to establish strategic partnership and to cultivate an environment of mutual cooperation, the Board attended various induction trainings and made visits. Notable among this being the visit made to PSC headquarters Nairobi, and the visit received from the SRC Chairman and Commissioners.
During the period, some of the Board’s key achievements include: advisories to the executive on HR planning, framework on job evaluation, CIDP, and performance management; recruitment of key positions and ECD teachers; staff headcount, amongst others.
In the discharge of its mandate the Board faced a number of challenges which included lack of office space; lack of a secretariat; and managing expectations of all stakeholders. The Board is aware of the high expectations on service delivery and prudent management of county public service.
I take this opportunity to thank all the stakeholders for having fully supported the board to deliver its mandate. We look forward to greater partnerships in the coming year.

CHALLENGES
During the period between July and December 2013, the Board faced a number of challenges in the discharge of its mandate under the County Government Act. These challenges include:
Lack of office space; Chairman and Secretary are currently accommodated at the Governor’s office complex.
Absence and/or conflicting guidelines managing transition.
Managing varied stakeholder expectations.
Harmonization of the different schemes of service of former Local Authorities staff and those of staff in the devolved functions.
Limited response to some advertised positions makes it difficult to meet the 1/3rd gender/people with disability threshold and regional balance while upholding merit and competence.
SHORT TERM PLANS
Within this fiscal year, the board intends to accomplish the following:

Key Result Area


Specific Objective


Roll out of the Human Resource Information System


The Human Resource Information System will be rolled out as soon as the Procurement process is concluded for cost effectiveness and efficiency.


Training


A robust need based training will be rolled out to the County staff across all cadres beginning February 2014. Chief Executive Committee members have been requested to allocate in their expenditure plan at least 30% of their total administrative budget to training. Chief Officers will conduct training needs assessment to enable this process.
All new County employees will go through induction training before commencing their new roles.


Performance Management Contracting                  


In order to measure performance, the board shall advise the executive on the implementation of performance contracting.
Through this we expect to improve the staff performance, manage nonperformance, recognize high performance and have concrete development plans for the employee. 
The expected outputs are improved service delivery and resource management.


Staff Motivation Initiatives


Employees engaged as casuals will be considered through competitive process for more preferential terms based on competence and experience, and establishment.

Strategic planning


In the month of March 2014 to June 2014, the board shall develop its strategic plan.


Regularization of staff on secondment


A structured approach towards proper placement of the staff who are currently on secondnment has been adopted. This involves recruiting internally initially before sourcing externally.
To liaise with the Salaries and Remuneration Commission to have the terms of the former Local Authority employees and those of National Government to be harmonized as per the Board’s mandate.

In consultation with the County Assembly, and through the CIDP framework, the Board targets to achieve the following:

Key Result Area


Activity


Training and capacity building of county public service


Construct County School of Government.
The institution to be constructed in phases so that by 5 years the school has conference facilities, lecture rooms, recreation facilities and hostels.
The facility to be constructed in the most underdeveloped/marginalized part of the county.


Making the county government an employer of choice – Housing


County government to set aside land to be used by the National Housing Corporation to develop houses to be purchased by public servants. 


Making the county government an employer of choice – terms of service


Allocate funds to special fund used to attract and retain exceptional talent to the public service in form of special allowances and improved terms of service outside SRC recommendations. 


Driving performance culture amongst County public service


Allocate funds for reward system for top performance

CONCLUSION
Elgeyo Marakwet County is endowed with a lot of resources that need to be tapped to realize improved socio-economic standards of her people. The board is cognizant of the pivotal role public servants play to achieve this, and to this end, the board reaffirms its commitment to its core values and that it will work to ensure that persons working in the county public service are properly aligned to deliver services to the citizens and that together our society will be transformed.
