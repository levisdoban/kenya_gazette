Promotion of the National values and Principles of Governance in the Public Service (Article 10 and 232 of the Kenya Constitution 2010).
The Murang’a County Public Service Board was constituted on 16th August, 2013 and since then,  in accordance with its mandate and powers; has undertaken the following successfully;
In readiness to offer effective and efficient services including compliance with the national values and principles of governance, the Murang’a county public service board made decisions to recruit for various cadres during the year ended 31st December 2014 as shown in Table 1.
The Board consists of the following Committees:

The Board in the course of executing its mandate undertook the following:
(a) Utilized the resources available to the board with efficiency, effectiveness, transparency and accountability.

Impediments faced by the Board in the Promotion of the National Values and Principles of Governance and Public Service.
In the performance of its function of promotion of national values and principles of governance in the public service, the board has experienced the following challenges:
Gender Balance
The Board has faced challenges in attaining gender balance due to;
Male and female candidates excelling in different professional skills and capacities.
Technical professions such as accounts, engineering and driving which attracts fewer female applicants than their male counterparts.
In conclusion the Board envisages that gender balance will be attained gradually. However, the Board continues to encourage female applicants in the advertisements for vacancies.
Residence by Marriage Vis-A-Vis Birth
Capturing data of applicants’ especially female applicants during data entry and short listing per Sub-county and wards creates confusion. At short listing, a candidate’s identification documents may indicate that she is from a particular County, whereas at the time of interview she clarifies that she is from a different County.  Such claims require proof such as Affidavit of Marriage Certificate which candidates normally lack.
Such confusion affects the allocation of appointments and balancing in the wards and Sub counties.
Regional Balancing
Whereas the board would want to uphold the requirement of regional balancing within the County, there have been challenges when it comes to meeting minimum requirements as per the advertised vacancies across the county.
Sometimes the Board finds out that during the shortlisting, there are no applicants from some regions in the Country.
The board supplements adverts on print media with posters within the County so as to  reach a wider audience.
Diverse Communities
Murang’a County is largely not cosmopolitan. People from other ethnic communities are present in the county mostly as public servants, students or members of the minority business community and applicants for various vacancies from diverse communities are few.
The law require that the Dominant Ethnic Group be 70 percent and non- Dominant Ethnic Group be 30 per cent according to section 55(1) (e) of the County Governments Act, No.17 of 2012. However, certain vacancies do not attract applicants from outside the Dominant Ethnic Group. The Board has strived to ensure this through advertisements that persons from other communities apply by indicating at all times that Murang’a County is an equal opportunity employer.
Political Environment
The Board recognizes the fact that it operates with in a political environment amongst others. This therefore can affect certain aspects of recruitments and selection exercise and by extension the board’s activities. The board however strives to remain non-political while at the same time encourage consultation and consensus building in the discharge of its duties and delivering on its mandate.
Inadequate Infrastructure
Inadequate infrastructure is still a challenge in Murang’a County as a whole and therefore by extension affects the Board’s intention to attract competitive candidates and qualified personnel in its Public Service. Some of the neighboring Counties are better off when it comes to infrastructure development thereby attracting applicants due to the same. The Board has noted that even some successful candidates are still compelled to seek residence in other Counties due to this challenge particularly when it comes to educational institutions, residential houses, ICT, medical facilities and road networks.
Persons with Disability
Advertised positions have so far attracted few people living with disabilities. The Board is currently seeking ways and means of capturing data on disabilities among the applicants; such initiatives may include requirements that enable the board to ascertain as at the time of short listing, information that can capture Persons Living with Disability.
Inadequate Funding
This has posed a challenge in the efficient delivery of services.
Recommendations to be implemented in the Promotion of Values and Principles
 The board recommends the following be applied in order to make the national values and principles of governance and of public service be adhered to and assist in having an efficient and effective County Public Service.
The County Government place Suggestions Boxes in all offices to ensure transparency in its’ operations.
The Board needs more training and capacity building programs in the area of good governance.
The Board be facilitated in terms of resource to enable it undertake its mandate.
Conclusion
The Board would wish to conclude by assuring all stakeholders that it is committed to ensuring that the National Values and Principles of Governance in the Public Service are adhered to: -
Undertaking a vigorous campaign to promote them among the public officers and the general public.
Formulating effective measures to promote the values and principles.
Formulating and implementing programs intended to inculcate in the county public officers the duty to uphold the values and principles.
Advising the County Government on its obligation under international treaties and conventions on good governance in the County Public Service. 
Visiting any county public office or body with a view to assessing and inspecting the status of compliance with the values and principles. 
Prompt investigation of any violation of values and principles and recommending to the relevant authorities for the necessary action to be taken. 
Cooperating with other institutions working in the field of good governance in the Public Service.
