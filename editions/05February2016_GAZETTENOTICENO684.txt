ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY REPORT FOR THE PROPOSED MINING AND ORE PROCESSING PLANT FOR KILIMAPESA GOLD (PTY) LTD (ON NEW SITE), LOLGORIAN TRANSMARA SUB-COUNTY, NAROK COUNTY
INVITATION OF PUBLIC COMMENTS
PURSUANT to regulation 21 of the Environmental Management and Co-ordination (Impact Assessment and Audit) Regulations, 2003, the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) has received an Environmental Impact Assessment Study Report for the above proposed project.
The proponent, Kilimapesa Gold (PTY) Limited propose to put a new production plant projected to mill 3000 tons of ore per month with 6000 tones new carbon in leach gold processing plant and a new tailing facility with an estimated footprint of more than 5Ha to contain a maximum of 500,000 tonnes tailing. The project site is located in Lolgorian, Transmara District 5 km West of Lolgorian Town, Narok County.
The following are the anticipated impacts and proposed mitigation measures:
