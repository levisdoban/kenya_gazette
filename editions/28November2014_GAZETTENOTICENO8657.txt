EACC/FI/INQ No. 47/2014
Inquiry into Allegations that the Machakos County Assembly Irregularly Single-sourced Sixty Second-hand Laptops for County Representatives at a Cost of KSh. 75,000 per Laptop
The investigations established the members of the Machakos County Assembly Tender Committee resolved that direct procurement be used in sourcing for the laptops and the committee engaged a firm that had previously supplied five lap tops to the county, to supply 60 laptops at a price of KSh. 75,000 per laptop. Investigations revealed that Tender Committee flouted procurement regulations in using the direct procurement method without meeting the pre-requisite requirements for the use of direct procurement. The fact that the financial year was coming to a close was not sufficient justification for adopting the said method. Investigations further established that the firm that was awarded the contract for the supply of the laptops was not qualified as they used false documents when submitting their bid for the 5 laptops.
A report was compiled and forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions on 24th September, 2014 recommending that the suspects be charged with the offences of careless failure to comply with the law relating to procurement of goods contrary to section 45 (2) (b) as read with section 48 of the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act, Wilful failure to comply with the law relating to procurement of goods contrary to section 45 (2) (b) as read with section 48 of the Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Act, Fraudulent practice in procurement contrary to section 41 (1) and (4) of the PPDA and Uttering a false document contrary to section 353 of the Penal Code.
