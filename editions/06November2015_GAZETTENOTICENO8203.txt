Liquid effluents
 


Design, construct, operate, and maintain wastewater treatment facilities and achieve effluent water quality consistent with applicable national requirements or internationally accepted standards and consistent with effluent water quality goals based on the assimilative capacity and the most sensitive end use of the receiving water.
Consider discharge of treated wastewater to natural or constructed wetlands, which can buffer the impact from discharge on the aquatic environment, unless the wetland itself would be degraded by the discharge.
Treat greywater, if collected separately from sewage, to remove organic pollutants and reduce the levels of suspended solids, pathogenic organisms and other problematic substances to acceptable levels based on applicable national and local regulations.
Based on an assessment of risks to human health and the environment, consider re-use of treated effluent, especially in areas with limited raw water supplies.
Monitoring the effluent quality through sampling and laboratory analysis.


Sludge disposal
 


Select appropriate sludge treatment technologies.
Develop and Implement faecal sludge management plan.
Land application or other beneficial re-use of wastewater treatment plant residuals should be considered but only based on an assessment of risks to human health and the environment.
Processing, disposal and re-use of wastewater treatment plant residuals should be consistent with applicable National requirements or, in their absence, internationally accepted guidance and standards.


Offensive odours
 


Provide adequate buffer area, such as trees, or fences, between processing areas and potential receptors.
Cover emission points (e.g., aeration basins, clarifiers, sludge thickeners, tanks, and channels), and vent emissions to control systems (e.g., compost beds, bio-filters, chemical scrubbers, etc.) as needed to reduce odours and otherwise meet applicable national requirements and internationally accepted guidelines;
Where necessary, consider alternate aeration technologies or process configurations to reduce volatilization.
