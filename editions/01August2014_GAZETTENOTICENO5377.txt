Title of the project
Applicant
Location(s) of experiment
Objective 
Date of approval
Application to introduce transgenic cassava containing Cassava Brown Streak Resistance Genes for confined field trials in Kenya
Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI)
KARI, Alupe Sub Station (Busia County) and KARI Mtwapa Centre (Kilifi County)
The objective of this project is to develop, obtain transgenic cassava with superior resistance to Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)
26th September 2013
Application to undertake confined field trial for the evaluation of transgenic Gyposphila paniculata (Baby’s Breath) containing PAP 1 genes for pink flower colour stability in Kenya
Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI)
Beauty Line Flower Company - Naivasha. -Nakuru County
The aim of the proposed work is to generate field biosafety data and evaluate the efficacy and stability of the inserted PAP 1 genes in terms of flower colour stability of transgenic Gypsophila varieties
9th December 2013
Application to conduct a confined field trial (CFT) of transgenic cassava expressing African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV) and cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) resistance in Kenya
Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology (MMUST) 
KARI- Alupe, Busia County
Evaluation of the robustness and stability of engineered resistance against cassava viruses, (African Cassava mosaic virus (ACMV) and Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) under natural field conditions (confined field trials)
6th March 2014
Application to undertake contained use activities on recombinant antigen delivery systems containing defined antigens of the ASFV and rationally attenuated ASFV viruses
International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI)
BSL 2 Facility at ILRI Campus – Nairobi
The overall objective of this project is to develop a recombinant vaccine for protection of pigs against African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV)
6th March 2014
Application for contained use activities involving the development of effective Rift Valley Fever vaccines for use in sheep
International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI)
BSL 2 Facility at ILRI Campus – Nairobi
The main aim of this work will be to identify a vaccination regimen that confers protection against RVF in sheep. The obtained data will provide proof-of-concept for future clinical trials in other livestock species
14th April 2014

International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI)
BSL 2 Facility at ILRI Campus – Nairobi
The overall objective of this project is to develop a recombinant vaccine for protection of cattle against East Coast Fever (ECF). 
14th April 2014
Application for contained use activities involving genetic modification on cassava expressing resistance to cassava bacterial blight disease (CBB) in Kenya
International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI)
ILRI Campus -Nairobi
The objective of the proposed research is to develop transgenic cassava resistant to Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB) using either single or additive approach
14th April 2014
Application for contained use activities involving Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of cowpea for improved drought tolerance 
International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI)
ILRI Campus -Nairobi
