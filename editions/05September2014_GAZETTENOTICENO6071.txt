ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDY REPORT FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF COPPER CABLES, LEAD ACID BATTERIES AND AUTOMOTIVE SPARE PARTS INCLUDING SMELTING AND RECYCLING OPERATIONS OF NON- FERROUS METAL SCRAP AND USED AUTOMOBILE
BATTERIES TO BE LOCATED ON TITLE NUMBER NAIVASHA/MWICHIRINGIRI BLOCK 2/253, NAKURU COUNTY
INVITATION OF PUBLIC COMMENTS
PURSUANT to regulation 21 of the Environmental Management and Co-ordination (Impact Assessment and Audit) Regulations, 2003, the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) has received an Environmental Impact Assessment Study Report for the above proposed project.
The Proponent (Ganesh Eco Solutions Limited) is proposing a development comprising a warehouse of approx. 10,000 square feet shall be built to carry out smelting and recycling activities of used automobile batteries and non-ferrous metal scrap. Office space, storage godowns, Toilets, Drainage, Electric Panel room, Security Guard room etc shall also be built in accordance to operations.
The plant shall be installed with the most modern manufacturing facilities. The highly sophisticated production process can mainly be divided into four phases:
To drain the USED LEAD ACID BATTERIES (ULAB's) in a specified platform to collect the acid in a pit and transfer this acid to the ETP for processing.
To sort out different Non-ferrous metal scrap and segregate.
Cutting of the drained ULAB's and separation of its contents into lead bearing parts and non-lead bearing parts.
Smelting of lead bearing parts through rotary furnace to recover lead in a raw form.
Smelting of various non-ferrous metal scrap in their respective furnaces to recover their respective metals in pure form.
Melting of raw lead in kettle pots for producing pure refined lead.
The refined lead then will be grinded in ball mill to produce the lead oxide powder of international grade
Manufacture of Copper Wire Rods from refined copper obtained from smelting operations.
Manufacture of Automotive Spare parts from respective Non- Ferrous metals.
The following are the anticipated impacts and proposed mitigation measures;
Negative Impacts                        Recommended Mitigation Measure's
Minimize extraction site impacts and ensure efficient use of raw materials in construction
High Demand of Raw material
Source building materials from local material  suppliers who use environmentally friendly processes in their operations.
Ensure accurate budgeting and estimation of actual construction material requirements to ensure that the least amount of material necessary is ordered. ,
Ensure that damage or loss of materials at the construction site is kept minimal through proper storage.
Use at least 5%-10% recycled, refurbished or salvaged materials to reduce the use of raw materials and divert material from landfills
 

2.Reduce storm-water, runoff and soil erosion
Increased storm water, runoff and soil erosion
Surface runoff and roof water shall be runoff and soil harvested and stored in underground erosion  reservoir for reuse.
A storm water management plan that minimizes impervious area infiltration by use of recharge areas and use of detention and/or retention with graduated outlet control structure will be designed.
3.Minimize solid waste generation and ensure efficient solid waste generation management during construction,
Increased solid waste generation
Use of an integrated solid waste   management system i.e. through a hierarchy of options: 1. Source reduction 2. Recycling 3.Composting and reuse 4. Combustion 5. Sanitary land filling.
Through accurate estimation of the sizes and quantities of materials required, order materials in the sizes and quantities they will be needed, rather than cutting them to size, or having large quantities of residual materials.
Ensure that construction materials left over at the end of construction will be used in other projects rather than being disposed of.
Ensure that damaged or wasted construction materials including cabinets, doors, plumbing and lighting fixtures, marbles and glass will be recovered for refurbishing and use in other projects
Donate recyclable/reusable or residual materials to local community groups, institutions and individual local residents or home owners.
Use of durable, long-lasting materials that will not need to be replaced as often, thereby reducing the amount of construction waste generated over time
Provide facilities for proper handling andstorage of construction materials to reduce the amount of waste caused by damage or exposure to the elements
Use building materials that have minimal or no packaging to avoid the generation of excessive packaging waste
Solid waste generation Segregate batteries from paper, rags, (Lead Acid Batteries) garbage, flammables, scrap metal or hazardous chemicals by means of a dike, berm, wall or other physical barrier.
Store spent lead acid batteries on an impervious surface (such as concrete that has been sealed to protect the surface from degradation or on a leak- proof plastic containment pallet).
4. Reduce dust emissionsdust emissions      
Ensure strict enforcement of on-site speed limit regulations
Avoid excavation works in extremely dry weathers
Sprinkle water on graded access routes when necessary to reduce dust generation by construction vehicles
 Personal protective equipment to be worn
5. Minimization of exhaust emissions
Exhaust emission                      
 Vehicle idling time shall be minimized
Alternatively fuelled construction equipment shall be used where feasible equipment shall be properly tuned and maintained
Sensitize truck drivers to avoid unnecessary racing of vehicle engines at loading/offloading points and parking areas, and to switch off or keep vehicle engines at these points
6. Minimization of Noise and Vibration
Noise and vibration
 Sensitize construction vehicle drivers and machinery operators to switch off engines of vehicles or machinery not being used.
Sensitize construction drivers to avoid gunning of vehicle engines or hooting especially when passing through sensitive areas such as churches, residential areas and schools
Ensure that construction machinery are kept in good condition to reduce noise generation
Ensure that all generators and heavy duty equipment are insulated or placed in enclosures to minimize ambient noise levels.
The noisy construction works will entirely be planned to be during day time when most of the neighbours will be at work.
 
7. Minimization of Energy Consumption
Increased  energy consumption 
Ensure electrical equipment, appliances and lights are switched off when not being used
 Install energy saving fluorescent tubes at all lighting points instead of bulbs which consume higher electric energy
8. Minimize water consumption and ensure more efficient and safe water use
Promptly detect and repair of water pipe and tank leaks
Ensure taps are not running when not in use
 Install a discharge meter at water outlets to determine and monitor total water usage
9. Minimize occupational health and safety risks Security                                       
  Ensure .the general safety and security at all times by providing day and night security guards and adequate lighting within and around the premises.
 Personal protective gear
Suitable overalls, safety footwear, dust masks, gas masks, respirators, gloves, ear protection equipment etc. should be made available and construction personnel must be trained to use the equipment
Healthy and safety impacts
Implement all necessary measures to ensure health and safety of workers and the general public during operation of the housing project as stipulated in Factories and Other Places of Work Act Cap 514
First Aid
Well stocked first aid box which is easily available and accessible should be provided within the premises Provision must be made for persons to be trained in first aid, with a certificate issued by a recognized body.
Fire protection
Fire fighting equipment such as fire extinguishers should be provided at strategic locations such as stores and construction areas.
 Regular inspection and servicing of the equipment must be undertaken by a reputable service provider and records of such inspections maintained
Signs such as "NO SMOKING" must be prominently displayed within the premises, especially in parts where inflammable materials are stored
