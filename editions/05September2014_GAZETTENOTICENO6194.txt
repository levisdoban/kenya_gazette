This report therefore dwells on this particular function of the board.
In the performance of its functions as given by Sec. 59 (1) (f) of the County Government Act, 2012 i.e. "Evaluate and report to the County Assembly on the extent to which the values and principles referred to in Articles 10 and 232 are complied with in the County Public Service;" the Board presents the following report to the County Assembly of Murang'a.
2.0 Promotion of the National values and Principles of Governance and of Public Service (Article 10 and 232 of the Kenya Constitution 2010).
The Murang'a County Public Service Board was constituted on 15th August, 2013 and since then, in accordance to its mandate and powers; has undertaken the following successfully;
In readiness to offer effective and efficient services including compliance with the national values and principles of governance, the Murang'a county public service board has recruited for the positions of County Secretary (1), Chief Officer (9), seven (7) sub-county administrator, Town Administrator (1) and various other junior positions as summarized as Table 1.0 of this report.
The Board has attended various workshopsdesigned to equip its members with the requisite skills and knowledge necessary for undertaking its mandate. They include:
An induction course undertaken by the Kenya School of Government in Nairobi.
A course on pension undertaken by LAPTRUST/ LAPFUND in Nairobi
Governance workshop organized by the Institute of Certified Public Secretaries of Kenya and Capital Market Authority in Nairobi.
        3. The Board has conducted a Human Resource Audit and a report on this is enclosed. A Summary of the report is as follows:
Summary Report from the Human Resource Audit
The total number of staff counted in the devolved departments was 2,716. The Health Department had the largest share of staff totaling to 1,274, followed by the Defunct Local Authority with 548. Agriculture, Fisheries & Livestock has 324. Distribution by Gender involved differentiating the officers in respective departments by Gender with the female being the largest employee at 1398 which constitutes 51.5% compared to the male who stood at 1316 constituting 48.5%.
Only 334 employees are 30 years old and below. This represents 12.3 % of the employees counted, 376 are aged between 30 and 35 years. Officers falling in the 51-55 age bracket were 626.A total of 301 are aged 55yrs and above. Therefore 34.2% of the current labour force is above 50 years old and due to leave the service within the next 10 years.
There were 68 cadres that represent the mix 'of skills and competencies inherent in the labor force deployed in the county, both from the mainstream civil service and defunct local authorities. Nurses were (632), Support Staff (232), Clerical Officers (177), Public Health Officers (140), Revenue Colle'ctors (140), Agricultural Officers (124) and Instructors (114). These constitute the cadres with the largest number totaling 1558 which is 57.40% of the staff counted.
An attempt to match the available labour force with the staffing criterion of the departments of the county government indicated that the county does not have enough staff to deliver some of the functions. To be specific the department of Education, Information and Technology is the most affected .The department of trade has only three officers on the ground, while public service department has only three human resource officers.
The resultant wage bill once all the devolved functions are taken over by the county government stands at Kshs.138, 098,827per month which translates to Kshs. 1,657,185,924 per year. This represents 29% of the total county expenditure.
From the foregoing, recommendations are made that a work load analysis be undertaken to establish the staff requirement of each department; there is need for harmonization of terms of service of all employees serving in the devolved functions and there is need for a clear and formal communication from line ministries to the staff in the devolved units at the county level.
4 The Board has formulated a functional structure by constituting Four (4) committees each headed by a board member and has a membership drawn from the rest of the board. The committees co-opt other members from relevant County Public Service departments from time to time. The adopted structure of the board is as follows;
Promotion of Values& Principles Committee
Recruitment and RestructuringCommittee
Performance Management Committee
Training& Development Committee
5. The Board in the course of executing its mandate strived to:
Utilize the resources available to the board with efficiency, effectiveness, transparency and accountability.
The Board has been prompt and impartial in the provision of services to the citizenry and is working on cementing a close working relationship with the executive arm as well as the county assembly and appreciates the need for the various offices to complementeach other for them to be effective.
6. The Board has developed a Draft County Human Resource Policy for adoption by Cabinet and a copy is enclosed as part of part of this report.
7. The Board has mainstreamed values and principles in performance management by including it in the performance management tool. The Board has also rolled out the wealth declaration forms to all its' staff.
2.1 Upcoming and On-going Programmes

3,0 Challenges or Impediments in the Promotion of the National
Values and Principles of Governance and Public Service.
In the performance of its function of promotion of national values and principles of governance and of public service, the board has experienced challenges which include the following:
(i)    Lack of sufficient resources to visit all areas the Board would want to in the promotion of principles and values.
(ii)   The Board has experienced resistance to change from staff > but the Board has continued and will continue sensitizing staff on the benefits and need for change.
(iii) The promotion of national values and principles of governance and public service is a constitutional requirement. However it remains a challenge fulfilling some of the requirements due to the following reasons:
Many applicants from either gender did not qualify for the positions applied for.
Many Persons with disabilities do not respond toadvertised applications. The Board is however mappingout persons with disabilities in the County with a view to being specific in reaching them out to this group.
4.0 Recommendations
The board recommends the following be applied in order to make the national values and principles of governance and of public service be adhered to and assist in having an efficient and effective County Public Service.
The County Government and all its personnel should be fully involved in the promotion, evaluation and monitoring compliance. In this regard, the Board will work with the Office of the County Commissioner of Murang'a to promote the same.
The Board should quickly be adequately resourced in order to effectively and efficiently undertake its role in the promotion, evaluation and enforcement of compliance.
The board should continuously engage in civic education in order to enlighten the Persons with Disabilities and those from minority communities in as far as job applications and other services are concerned.
5.0 Conclusion

Undertaking a vigorous campaign to promote them among the public officers and the general public.
