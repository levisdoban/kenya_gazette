4.0  CHALLENGES FACED BY THE BOARD IN PROMOTING VALUES AND PRINCIPLES STATED IN ARTICLES 10 AND 232 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF KENYA 2010
4.1    GENDER BALANCE
The Board has faced challenges in attaining gender balance due to;
Male and Female candidates  excelling in different professional skills and capacities
Technical professions such as accounts, engineering and driving which attracts fewer female applicants than their male counterparts
Other field based professions such as Sub County and Ward Administrators also attracted fewer female candidates owing to the strenuous and rigorous nature of the training and the job.
 
In conclusion the Board notes that gender balance will be attained gradually. However, the Board continues to encourage female applicants during advertisements for vacancies in the various cadres.
4. 2 RESIDENCE BY MARRIAGE VIS-A-VIS BIRTH
Capturing data of applicants especially female applicants during data entry and short listing  per Sub- county and wards creates confusion. At short listing, a candidate's identification documents may indicate that she is from a particular Ward, whereas  at the time of interview she clarifies that she is from a different ward. Such claims requires proof such as Affidavit or Marriage Certificate which candidates normally lack.
 
Such confusion affects the allocation of appointments and balancing in the wards and Sub counties.
4.3   REGIONAL   BALANCING
Whereas the board would want to uphold the requirement of regional balancing within the County, there have been challenges when it comes to meeting minimum requirements as per the advertised vacancies across the county.
 
Applicants from certain areas are usually disadvantaged due to their levels of qualifications. The board has however had to invoke affirmative measures to mitigate these challenges to ensure equity and social justice.
 
The board supplements adverts on print media with electronic particularly the local vernacular radio stations to reach a wider audience.
The board further launched its website in October, 2014   at www.siaya.cpsb.co.ke to further reach even a more wider audience.
 4.4  DIVERSE COMMUNITIES
Siaya County is largely not cosmopolitan. People from other ethnic communities are present in the county mostly as public servants, students or members of the minority business community.
 
Applicants for various vacancies are few and mainly from the neighboring counties.
 
The law requires that the Dominant Ethnic Group be 70per cent  and non-Dominant Ethnic Group be 30 per cent according to section  65 (1) (e) of the County Governments Act, No.17 of 2012. However, certain vacancies do not attract applicants from outside the Dominant Ethnic Group. To mitigate this, the Board has at times resorted to head hunting. As at now, Non- Dominant Ethnic Group stands at 5.93 per cent.  It is the voluntary personal decision of an applicant to choose to respond to a vacancy announcement, however, it is the duty of the county government and by extension the Board to assure the eligible candidates of stability in job tenure. The Board has strived to ensure this through advertisements by indicating at all times that Siaya County is an equal opportunity employer.
4 .5   POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT
The board recognizes the fact that it operates within a political environment amongst others. This therefore can affect certain aspects of recruitment and selection exercise and by extension the board's activities. The board however strives to remain apolitical while at the same time encourage consultation and consensus building in the discharge of its duties and delivering on its mandate.
4.6   INADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE 
Inadequate infrastructure is still a challenge in Siaya County as a whole and therefore by extension affects the Board's intention to attract competitive candidates and qualified personnel in its Public Service. Some of the neighboring Counties are better off when it comes infrastructure development thereby attracting applicants due to the same. The Board has noted that even some successful candidates are still compelled to seek residence in other Counties due to this challenge particularly when it comes to educational institutions, residential houses, ICT, medical facilities and road networks.
4.7   PERSONS WITH DISABILITY
Advertised positions have so far attracted few people living with disabilities. The board is currently looking at ways and means of capturing data on disabilities among the applicants.  Such initiatives may include requirements that enables the board to ascertain as at the time of short listing,  information that can capture Persons Living With Disability . It is however important to recognize that vacancies such as drivers or ward administrators which require physical presence, para- military training or strenuous work, may pose a challenge to such persons living with disabilities.
 
Despite the challenge, there have been people living with disability as successful candidates. 
4.8   INADEQUATE FUNDING
In the Financial Year 2014/2015 the board budgeted for Kshs. 107 Million for its operations. However, the board was allocated KSh. 53 Million which is less that 50 per cent of its budget. This has posed a challenge in the effective and efficient delivery of services. For example, the allocation of Kshs. 3Million for advertisement has already been exhausted as at November, 2014 thereby hampering recruitment and selection exercise.
4.9   OFFICE SPACE
The board's offices are currently located at Ardhi House, Bondo. The Board is accommodated in the premise on tenancy basis. This poses the following challenges:
Commuter and shuttle difficulties to and from the County headquarters.
Inadequate office space and Board rooms to host both the Board Members and the Board's Secretariat.
Lack of security, particularly for documents, information and assets.
The board, in mitigation, has sourced for Bills of Quantity from Department of Lands, Survey and Housing  and applied for development funds for refurbishment of a block that has been donated by the Bondo Sub county Commissioner. The requests are pending at the offices of Director of Procurement and that of the Interim County Secretary.
5.0   WORKPLAN TO FORMULATE AND PROMOTE VALUES AND PRINCIPLES
The board plans to launch the Siaya County  Public Service Board Strategic Plan 2014- 2019 and the Siaya County Public Service Board Bill (proposed), in 2015 to ensure sustainable development and continuity of good governance in the implementation of its statutory functions and powers, as well as the tenets of Article 10 and 232 of the Constitution. The board shall ensure public participation and democracy in the process.
The board plans to exercise its powers under section 59 (4) (a) and (i) of the County Governments Act, 2012 to inform and educate Siaya County  Public Officers and the public about the values and principles and recommend to the County Government of Siaya  effective measures to promote the values and principles.
The board will assist the county in the formulation and implementation  of  programmes  intended to inculcate in the public officers and the public the duty to uphold the values and principles. It will continuously assess and report on the status of compliance with the values and principles and hear complaints on the same and recommend actions to be taken on the issues raised.
It  will continue visiting the various work stations, offices and bodies at all levels within the County to ensure compliance to the values and principles in Article 10 and 232 of the Constitution  of  Kenya, 2010.
The board has initiated partnership, networking and  exchange  programmes locally and overseas in its quest to cover a wider margin in the promotion of values and principles in its third year,2015. An example are the recent visits to the Public Service Commission of Kenya, The Directorate of Public Service Management and the UN Habitat.
6.0   CONCLUSION
The board will strive to enhance, promote and entrench the tenets of Article 10 and 232 of the Constitution of Kenya 2010 in the public service and the public of Siaya County.
