Challenges of Article 10 and 232 of the Consitution of Kenya 
Gender Balance 
The Drafters of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 could not have foreseen that gender imbalance is a natural phenomenon that can be improved upon but not enforced in all cases. Males and Females excel in different professional skills and capacities.
An example, fewer women applicants are Accountants registered by Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Kenya (ICPAK) than men, therefore more men will be shortlisted.
On the reverse, few men Applicants have Diploma in Secretarial work.
Requirement on gender parity is carried forward to other common cadre and middle management to address such imbalances. Academic   standards as per the skills required for a job may not be lowered to favour any gender as this would be discriminatory.
Appointment of Women.
Ascertaining domicile for women applicants and interviewees is a challenge.
This is as a result of failure by the women to formalize their marital status and fear to state their domicile according to their areas of marriage due to apprehension on consideration for selection.
The Board however, continues to clarify at all levels during the Recruitment and Selection exercise that Siaya County is an Equal Opportunity Employer.
Regional   Balancing
The Board endeavors to balance Applicants on regional basis i.e. Sub-counties, Wards and Non-Dominant Communities.
The Board also works within the standards and requirements of National Cohesion and Integration Commission by forwarding regular reports
 Non- Dominant Community
Siaya County is not largely cosmopolitan.
Applicants from other Counties applying for vacancies in Siaya are few and are from mainly Western, Rift Valley and Kisii County.
The requirement for  Dominant Ethnic Group is  70%  and non-Dominant Ethnic Group is 30% according to section  65 (1) (e) of the County Governments Act, No.17 of 2012.
This requirement still remains a challenge.
  As at December, 2015   the total number of new Employees is 379.   351 are from the Dominant Ethnic Group while 28 are from Non-Dominant Ethnic Group at 92.6 % and 7.4 % respectively.
Political Environment
The political environment contributes to a reasonable extent towards the dismal numbers of applications by Non-Dominant Ethnic Community.
The Board has embarked on intensive sensitization and Educational initiatives to assure the Non- Dominant communities on their welfare, security (including their families) while offering services within Siaya County.
The County of Choice 
The Board is determined to work with the Executive and the Assembly in ensuring conducive work environment and infrastructure to make Siaya County a County of Choice.
Persons with Disability 
Few people with disabilities have applied for vacancies in the Siaya County Government. In letters of application they do not mention the disability or registration with PLWD-(Persons living with Disability).
There are vacancies such as Drivers or Ward Administrators that require physical presence or para- military training or strenuous work that persons with disabilities may find difficult to perform   depending on the nature of disability.
The Board appointed more persons with disability during the year under review. Examples are: - Ward Administrator, Livestock Extension Officer and Chief Officer Roads Public Works and Infrastructure. The Board anticipates appointing more persons living with disability in the year 2016.
Such appointed Human Resource will be assigned duties favorable to their conditions. 
Inadequate Funding
The Board experiences Financial challenges with cash flow. There is budgetary constraints because the Board is clustered under the Executive. This subjects the Board to the feeling of the Executive when it comes to amount of cash remmited to the  Board.
Financial requisition is also done on a monthly basis leading to challenges expecially when large amounts are required for certain activities. For instance, when 7million is required for purchase of a vehicle and only 4million shillings is remmitted.
Fleet Availability
Availability of adequate means of transort was a major challenge at the beginning of the year when the Board had only one vehilce which was under the use of the Chairman. The Board has since purchased two more vehicles to facilitate its activities.
Office Space
The Board officesf are currently located at Ardhi House Bondo, The Board is accommodated  in the premise on tenanacy basis. This poses the following challenges.
Commuter and shuttle difficulties to and from the County Headquarters.
Inadequate office space and Board rooms to host both the Board members and the Board Secretariat.
Lack of security, particularly for documents, information and assets.
The Board, in mitigation, applied for development funds to complete a block that was under construction by the former Bondo Town Council.
Workplan to Formulate and Promote Values and Principles.
The Board has in its Work Plan the launching of the Siaya County  Public Service Board Strategic Plan 2014/2018, Siaya County Public Service Board Service Charter, Siaya County Human Resource Manual/Code of Regulations and the Siaya County Public Service Board Bill, in 2016 to ensure sustainable development and continuity of good governance in the implementation of its statutory functions and powers, also the tenets of Article 10 and 232 of the Constitution. It will involve the people in the process of Policy making, discussion of Strategic Plan 2014- 2018, and the Siaya County Public Service Board Bill.
The Board has plans to exercise its powers under Section 59 (i) of the County Governments Act to inform and educate the Siaya County Public Service Officers and the Public about the values and principles and to recommend to the County Government of Siaya effective measures to promote the values and principles.
 The Board will assist the County in the formulation and implementation of programmes intended to inculcate in the Public Officers the duty to uphold the values and principles. It will assess the status of compliance with the values and principles and hear complaints on the same and recommend actions to be taken on issues raised.
It will visit the various work stations at the Sub-County, Ward and Village levels to ensure that values and principles in Articles 10 and 232 of the Constitution of Kenya 2010 are entrenched in the Siaya County Government.  The Board will also sensitize Siaya County residents on the National Values and Principles of Governance.
The Board will equally seek Partnership, networking and exchange programmes locally and Internationally  in its quest to cover a wider margin in the promotion of values and principles in 2016 (its fourth year of existence).
Conclusion
The Board remains committed to delivering on its mandate as per the Constitution of Kenya, 2010, The County Government Acts, 2012 and all relevant legislation to ensure efficient and effective service delivery to the residents of Siaya County and all the stakeholders.
