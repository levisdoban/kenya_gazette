In the course of the hearing, the Commission requested the parties to negotiate some settlement.

(a) The Respondent did not respond to the Complainant’s letters until 15th March, 2006, a period of over 10 months.
(b) The Complainant had experienced power interruptions over a period of 2 years between 29th April 2005 and 3rd March, 2007.
(c)  The Respondent resolved the power interruptions problems with effect from 3rd March, 2007, facts confirmed by Mr. George Karanja, the Complainant’s Caretaker in his oral evidence before the Commission.
19. On the basis of the facts in paragraph 18 (c) above, the Commission makes a finding that the Complainant’s first relief sought in its complaint dated 3rd May, 2007 has been overtaken by events. Consequently, the said relief, viz, that the Respondent do forthwith take remedial and/or corrective action to ensure that the complaint is permanently resolved and that the Complainant receives regular and uninterrupted power supply and that the aforesaid power supply interruptions and fluctuations do not recur, is hereby disposed of.
20. The main issues in dispute in this Complaint are—
(a) Whether the Respondent was negligent for failing to resolve the Complainant’s power interruptions and/or failing to respond to the Complainant’s letters dated 11th May 2005 , 15th June 2005, 26th August, 2005, 8th November, 2005 and 9th March, 2006 until 15th March, 2006.
(b) Whether the Complainant is entitled to compensation amounting to KSh. 773,575.10 being the equipment repair and replacement charges, routine maintenance, installation of delay mechanisms and cost of wiring the main contactors in form of damages.
(c)  Whether the Complainant is entitled to compensation amounting to KSh. 1,115,373.00 being the cost of diesel utilized by standby generators during the time in which electric power was interrupted in form of damages.
(d) Whether the Commission has jurisdiction to award the above damages as prayed for by the Complainant in his Complaint, in any event.
21. Whether the Respondent was negligent for failing to resolve the Complainant’s power interruptions and/or failing to respond to the Complainant’s letters dated 11th May, 2005 , 15th June, 2005, 26th August, 2005, 8th November 2005 and 9th March, 2006 until 15th March, 2006.
(a) If the Respondent had attended to the Complainant’s power interruptions in a timely and conscientious manner, this complaint would not have been filed. Consequently, the Commission has no hesitation in finding that the Respondent was negligent in providing uninterrupted services to the Complainant.
22. Whether the Complainant is entitled to compensation amounting to KSh. 773,575.10 being the equipment repair and replacement charges, routine maintenance, installation of delay mechanisms and cost of wiring the main contactors.
(a) The Complainant has attached a copy of a receipt in the sum of KSh. 570,100.55 which appears at page 27 of the Complaint as Annex “K” in support of the repair of Chiller II.
(b) In his oral evidence on this item, the Complainant’s witness a Mr. Stephen Mutisya, a refrigeration and air conditioner technician from Hall Equatorial Ltd, informed the Commission how he was called by the Complainant sometimes in July, 2006 because the Chiller had broken down. He stated that the motors in the compressor and the display control card had burnt. As a result, he recommended and carried out an overhaul of the compressor by installing the parts set out in a copy of their letter dated 25th July, 2006 which appears at page 16 of the Complaint. The witness attributed the damaged components in the Chiller to power fluctuations and interruptions. Mr. Mutisya denied, under cross examination, that the parts replaced on the Chiller were not burnt and were due to wear and tear.
(c)  In further proof of the claim under this head, the Complainant has attached copies of the quotations, invoices, receipts and field service reports at pages 29 to 44 of the Complaint in support of repairs to the standby generator, installation of delay mechanisms, wiring of the main contactors, trickle charger, replacement of batteries, replacement of fuses, capacitors, exchange fan and for replacement of various types of bulbs.
(d) In his oral evidence on the repairs to the standby generator, the Complainant’s witness a Mr. Paul Nganga Ndungu, a technician from Ferguson Power E. A. Ltd, informed the Commission that he had been called by the Complainant after the generator had failed to start on several occasions. That upon inspection he discovered that some components to the control panel had been burnt. As a result, he recommended and the generator was installed with delay mechanisms, wiring of the main contactors, trickle charger and replacement of 2 batteries. The witness attributed the damage to these items to power fluctuations and interruptions. Under cross examination, Mr. Ndungu admitted that the installation of the delay mechanism was to protect the generator from malfunctioning and was a form of upgrading. He further admitted that the 2 batteries were replaced as they were old as stated in their letter dated 3rd July 2006 appearing at page 40 of the complaint.
(e)  After careful consideration of the Complainant’s claim under this head, the Commission finds, on a balance of probabilities, that the Complainant has proved that the Chiller had broken due to power fluctuations and interruptions.
23. Whether the Complainant is entitled to compensation amounting to KSh. 1,115,373.00 being the cost of diesel utilized by standby generators during the time in which electric power was interrupted in form of damages.
(a) The Complainant has attached copies of receipts and invoices in the sum of KSh. 1,115,373.00 which appear at pages 45 to 63 of the Complaint as Annex “L” in support of the cost of diesel utilized by standby generators.
(b) In his oral evidence on this item, the Complainant’s witness a Mr. George Karanja, the Caretaker of the premises hereof informed the Commission that the Complainant experienced frequent power fluctuations and interruptions between April 2005 and April 2007 and during that period they utilized a lot of diesel on the generators. Under cross examination, Mr. Karanja admitted that there was no comparative data showing power bills when the power supply was normal vis a vis when the generator was utilized to justify diesel expenses claimed. In addition the Complainant did not isolate the costs of running the generator on occasions other than due to power fluctuations.
(c)  The finding of the Commission on this head of claim is that, in the absence of comparative data as alluded to by the Respondent’s counsel, it is difficult to make a fair determination hereof. Consequently, the Commission rejects the Complainant’ claim amounting to KSh. 1,115,373.00 being the cost of diesel utilized by the standby generators.
24. Whether the Commission has jurisdiction to award the above damages as prayed for by the Complainant in his Complaint, in any event
(a) The Respondent’s counsel has raised this issue in his supplementary submissions dated 4th March 2011 and stated that the Commission has held in its previous findings that it has no jurisdiction to award damages.
(b) The Respondent’s counsel has relied upon the Complaint of Joseph Kinyanjui Mwai T/A Sandworth Printing and Packaging –vs- Kenya Power and Lighting Company Limited: Dispute N0.2 of 2009 (Gazette Notice No. 2618 dated 13th March 2009) for the said proposition.
(c)  The Commission notes that this is a point of law which should have been raised in the Respondent’s pleadings or which the Respondent should have issued a notice to the Complainant that it would be raised at the hearing to give the Complainant the opportunity to present any arguments to counter it. This is not the case here. Consequently, it would be unfair to the Complainant if the Commission made any finding on this point.
(d) In any event, the two cases are distinguishable by the nature of reliefs sought hence the Joseph Kinyanjui Mwai dispute is not relevant in the instant case.
25. The decision of the Commission on this dispute is as follows-
(a) THAT Respondent shall pay within 30 days of the gazettement of this decision the—
(i)    sum of KSh. 570,100.55 to the Complainant,
(ii)   Complainant’s advocates reasonable costs based on (i) above as may be agreed on between the parties or to be determined by the Commission upon presentation of a bill of costs,
(iii)  The Commission’s costs.
(b) THAT balance of the Complainant’s claim in the sum of KSh. 1,318,847.55 (KSh. 1,115,373.00 being the cost of diesel utilized by standby generators and KSh. 203,474.55 being the cost repairs to the standby generator and replacement of two old batteries) is hereby disallowed.
Orders accordingly.
Dated and signed at Nairobi this 1st day of April, 2011.
