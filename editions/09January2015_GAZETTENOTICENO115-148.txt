Box 381, Ukwala in the Republic of Kenya, is registered as proprietor of that piece of land known as North Ugenya/Siranga/1186, situate in the district of Siaya, and whereas the land registrar has ordered that the said piece of land be transferred to Maurice Owino Omanyo, and whereas all efforts made to compel the registered proprietor to surrender the land title deed issued to the land registrar have failed, notice is given that after the expiration of thirty (30) days from the date hereof, provided no valid objection has been received within that period, I intend to dispense with the production of the said land title deed and proceed with registration of the said instrument of transfer and issue a title deed to the said Maurice Owino Omanyo, and upon such registration the land title deed issued earlier to the said David Oduor Ogeda, shall be deemed to be cancelled and of no effect.
