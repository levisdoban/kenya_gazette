BUSIA COUNTY GOVERNMENT
BUSIA COUNTY PUBLIC SERVICE BOARD
Executive Summary
This report provides an account of performance progress attained by the County Public Service Board of the County Government of Busia in 2013/14 financial year. The County Public Service Board is established under Section 57 of the County Governments Act 2012 to establish and abolish offices in the county public service, appoint persons to hold or act in offices in the county public service including the Boards of Cities and Urban areas and exercise disciplinary control over human resource  in the county public service. In addition, the County Public Service Board is required to prepare regular reports and submit the same to the County Assembly, as well as evaluate and report to the County Assembly the extent to which national values and principles expressed in Articles 10 and 232 of the Constitution are complied with in the public service. Moreover, the County Public Service Board is required to facilitate the development of coherent integrated human resource planning, make recommendations to the Salaries and Remuneration Commission on behalf of the County Government on, remuneration, pension and gratuities of county public service employees.
During the current reporting period, the Board undertook several approaches to achieve its mandate that was accomplished through regular fortnightly Board sittings, special meetings and ad hoc meetings. Key accomplishments included staff recruitment to fill the vacant positions of Chief Officers, Sub-County Administrators and Ward Administrators.   It is important to emphasize that recruitment to fill the said positions was carried out transparently and competitively, taking into account to the extent possible, ethnic and gender diversity as well as consideration for people with disabilities. At the same time, the Board acting on departmental staff needs assessment, presided over the competitive recruitment and eventual appointment of various cadres of staff in the county public service to provide essential operational service at the County Treasury, Supply Chain Management   Office, Payroll Office and ICT Office among others.
The Board also conducted suitability interviews that culminated in consideration for regularization of appointment for 10 medical doctors, two pharmacists and 172 Economic Stimulus Programme staff in the Departments of Health and Sanitation and of Agriculture and Animal Resource. Similar suitability interviews were conducted by the Board for staff that originated from the defunct local authorities with a view to placing such staff appropriately based on their competencies, skills and qualification, a process is soon expected to be completed.
More recently, and guided by Section 66 of the County Governments Act 2012,  the Board advertised for the Position of County Secretary, shortlisted and interviewed qualified candidates through a process that is expected to be completed soon. Similarly the Board advertised for ninety three (93) positions of different cadres from the Department of Health and Sanitation whose shortlisting is nearing completion.
During the current reporting period, the Board facilitated staff training targeted at induction of newly recruitment staff and also on a sensitization of staff on national values, principles of public service. In particular, the Board held a workshop to sensitize senior staff including County Executive Committee Members, Chief Officers and the Public Service Board Members on obligations of the County to International Treaties and Conventions. This was line with Section 59 (1) (e) and (4) (d) of the County Governments Act, 2012. The sensitization provided a benchmark for the Board to monitor and evaluate compliance on the National Values and principles of public service in every department in future.
Finally, the Board was able to develop a number  of guideline documents to standardize and streamline human resource management and training operations The Human Resource Development and Training Guidelines and a document on Functions, Organization Structure and Staffing for the County Government of Busia, serve to illustrate this point. In addition, the Board prepared the Draft Strategic Plan which when finalized, will form the basis of guiding the Board’s activities over the next five years thereby ensuring that the County Public Service moves towards a cohesive strategic direction. The Board through this Strategic Plan intends to inculcate national values, institutional capacity and professionalism for improved citizen-centred service delivery by ensuring a vibrant and productive work force that is able to spur economic growth in the County.

Office of the County Secretary
Section 56 of the County Governments Act provides that every county shall, in accordance with Article 235 (1) of the Constitution, have its own public service headed by the County Secretary. The office of the County Secretary is established under section 44(1) of the County Governments Act in respect of each county. The functions of this office are set out in section 44(3) of the Act and are central to the effective and efficient functioning of a county government. The County Secretary is appointed in accordance with section 44(2) of the Act.
Since the constitution of Busia County Government following the general elections of 4th of March 2013, Busia County did not have a substantive holder of the office of County Secretary. An Interim Secretary held the office pending appointment of a substantive holder thereof.
By a notice published in The Standard and The Daily Nation Newspapers of 23rd and 24th 2013 respectively, CPSB invited applications for position to the office of County Secretary for Busia County.  Applications were received and, on evaluation, were short-listed. Of the short-listed applicants, only one was interviewed and H.E. the Governor nominated and submitted her name to the County Assembly for approval before appointment as required by law.
Unfortunately, this nomination raised quite some controversy both within and outside the County Assembly. Nevertheless, the County Assembly approved the nomination and H.E. the Governor duly appointed her to the office. However, hardly a month after the appointment, the County Secretary tendered her resignation and it became necessary to re-start the process of recruitment and appointment of the County Secretary.
By a notice published in the Standard Newspaper of 15th October 2014, CPSB advertised a vacancy in the office of the County Secretary and invited applications there-for, which were received and shortlisted by CPSB. By notices published in the Standard and the Star newspapers of 10th   and 11th   November 2014 respectively, the short-listed applicants were invited to attend interviews on 25th November 2014.
CPSB has prepared its report on the interviews results for forwarding it to H.E. the Governor for further action as he may deem necessary.
Other Appointments
Further, CPSB acting on departmental staff needs presided over the competitive recruitment and eventual appointment of various cadres of staff in the county public service to provide essential operational service at the County Treasury, Supply Chain Management Office, Payroll Office and ICT Office among others during the year under review.

The County Public Service Board of Busia realizes that without a clearly defined and articulated strategy, success in service delivery may be a pipe dream and could inadvertently drive the fledgling County Government of Busia on costly path to failure. Thus the Board has noted the need to develop a shared vision and strategy on how to meet its mandate and provide institutional leadership necessary for improved service delivery. 
To this end, the Board is about to finalize a Strategic Plan which forms the basis of guiding the Board’s activities over the next five years thereby ensuring that the County Public Service moves towards a cohesive strategic direction.

The Board noted   some irregularities in the applications of procedures that have been addressed by invoking   Section 75 of the County Government Act.
Motor vehicles for the Board not yet purchased.
Secretariat for the Board not yet recruited.
CONCLUSION
The County Public Service Board would have wished to undertake more activities especially sensitization of staff on the national values and principles of public service but is constrained by budgetary allocations that are not sufficient.
RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE WAY FORWARD
The  County Assembly to fast –track the passage of  Village Administrators for purposes of their recruitment.
Allow funding  for staffing  of the  County Public Service  secretariat  for the Board to discharge its mandate effectively and efficiently.
Improve budgetary allocation for purposes of training and sensitizing public officers on the national values and principles of public service.
