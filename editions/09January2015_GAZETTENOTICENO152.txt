THAT the harvesting of sand for commercial purposes within Makueni County is hereby suspended indefinitely and Pursuant to the Provisions of Section 69(1) of the Constitution as read with the Schedule 4 of the Constitution and Sections 30 and 31 of the County Governments Act, until a substantive legislation is passed to regulate the process.

That local communities have been exploited by being paid negligible compensation for their labour, road access and resources.
