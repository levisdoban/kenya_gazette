REPORT OF THE AUDITOR-GENENERAL ON DEPOSIT PROTECTION FUND BOARD FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2014
REPORT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The accompanying financial statements of Deposit Protection Fund Board set out below which comprise the statement of financial position as at 30th June, 2014, and statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statement of changes in fund balance equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information have been audited on my behalf by KPMG Kenya auditors appointed under section 39 of the Public Audit Act, 2003 and in accordance with the provisions of Article 229 of the Constitution of Kenya. The auditors have duly reported to me the results of their audit and on the basis of their report, I am satisfied that all the information and explanations which to the best of my knowledge and belief, were necessary for the purpose of the audit were obtained.
Director’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and for such internal control as Directors’ determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.
The Directors are also responsible for the submission of the financial statements to the Auditor-General in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Public Audit Act, 2003.
Auditor-General’s Responsibility
My responsibility is to express an independent opinion on the financial statements based on the audit and report in accordance with the provisions of section 15(2) of the Public Audit Act, 2003 and submit the audit report in compliance with Article 229(7) of the Constitution of Kenya. The audit was conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require compliance with ethical requirements and that the audit be planned and performed to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgments, including the assessment of the risks of the material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Board internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting estimates made by the Directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
I believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.
Opinion
In my opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects the financial position of the Deposit Protection Fund Board as at 30 June 2014, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Banking Act Cap. 488 of the laws of Kenya.

Auditor-General.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2014
 
1.            REPORTING ENTITY
The Board is incorporated under the Banking Act Cap 488 of the Laws of Kenya and is domiciled in Kenya. The address of its registered office is as follows:
 
CBK Pension House (formerly Marshall House)
Harambee Avenue
PO Box 45983 - 00100
Nairobi
 
2.            BASIS OF PREPARATION
 
(a)         Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost convention.
          
(b)         Statement of compliance
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs).
 
(c)          Functional and presentation currency
These financial statements are presented in Kenya Shillings (KShs), which is the Board’s functional currency.
 
(d)         Use of estimates and judgments
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates and assumptions are based on the Directors’ best knowledge of current events, actions, historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about the carrying values of the assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to the accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
In particular, information about significant areas of estimation and critical judgement in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amount recognised in the financial statement is described in Note 4.
 
3.            SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
(a)         Revenue recognition
Assessed income comprises contributions levied to the contributory institutions and is recognized in the period when they are receivable. Such contributions are assessed at a rate of 0.15 per cent of the average of the institutions’ total deposit liabilities during the period of 12 months prior to the date of levy notice.
Interest income is recognized in the profit or loss for all interest earning instruments on an accrual basis using the effective interest method based on the actual purchase price. Interest income includes coupon earned and unamortized discount and premium.
(b)         Translation of foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies during the year are converted into Kenya Shillings at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the reporting date.  Resulting exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss for the year.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are recorded at the exchange rate ruling at the date of transaction.
(c)          Provisions for payments to depositors
Provisions for payments to protected depositors are recognized in the financial statements in the period the contributory institutions are placed under liquidation. Any payments that exceed the provisions made are taken into account in determining operating profit. Provisions that relate to unclaimed protected deposits are written back to income on expiry of the statutory notice period.
(d)         Leases
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are recognized as an expense in the profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
(e)          Employee entitlements
Employee entitlements are recognized when they accrue to employees. A provision is made for the estimated liability for such entitlements as a result of services rendered by employees up to the reporting date. The estimated monetary liability for employees’ accrued annual leave entitlement at the reporting date is recognized as an expense accrual.
(e)      Employee entitlements (continued)
The Board’s employees are eligible for retirement benefits under a defined benefit plan provided through a separate fund. The defined benefit plan is funded by the Board and the Central Bank, the main sponsor. The retirement benefit asset is wholly recognized in the financial statements of the Central Bank while the Board recognizes contributions to the fund as if it were a defined contribution scheme by charging them to the profit and loss account in the year to which they relate.
The Board also contributes to a statutory defined contribution Pension Scheme, the National Social Security Fund (NSSF). The Board’s contributions are charged to the income statement in the year to which they relate. The Board has no further obligation once the contributions have been paid.
(f)          Taxation
The Board’s income is not subject to tax as it has been granted exemption by the statute. Therefore no provision for current tax or deferred tax is made in the financial statements.
(g)         Financial assets and liabilities
(i)           Recognition
The Board recognizes all financial assets and liabilities on the trade date at which the Board becomes a party to the contractual provision of the instrument. A financial asset or liability is initially measured at fair value plus (for an item not subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss) transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue.
Subsequently, held-to-maturity investments and loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost.
(ii)         Classification
The Board classifies its financial assets in the held-to-maturity and loans and receivables category. The Board classifies its financial liabilities as measured at amortised cost. Management determines the classification of its investments at initial recognition.
Held-to-maturity
Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Board’s management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. Were the Board to sell other than an insignificant amount of held-to-maturity assets, the entire category would be tainted and reclassified as available for sale. These include investment in government securities.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise when the Board provides money directly to borrowers, other than those created with the intention of short-term profit taking.  They are recognised at the date money is disbursed to the borrower or when they are transferred to the Board from a third party.
Subsequent to initial recognition, these are carried at amortised cost, which is the present value of the expected future cash flows, discounted at the instrument’s original effective interest rate. Loan origination fees together with related direct costs are treated as part of the cost of the transaction.
Amortised cost is calculated using the effective interest rate method.  The amortisation and accretion of premiums and discounts is included in interest income.
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost. These include other payables and amounts due to related companies.
(iii)        Identification and measurement of impairment of financial assets
At each reporting date the Board assesses whether there is objective evidence that financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss are impaired. Financial assets are impaired when objective evidence demonstrates that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, and that the loss event has an impact on the carrying amount.
Impairment losses on assets carried at amortized cost are measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial assets and the present value of estimated cash flows discounted at the assets’ original effective interest rate. Losses are recognized in profit or loss and reflected in an allowance account. Interest on the impaired asset continues to be recognized through the unwinding of the discount.
When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.
(iv)        Derecognition
The Board derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any interest in transferred financial assets that is created or retained by the Board is recognized as a separate asset or liability.
The Board derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire.
The Board enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognized on its statement of financial position, but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets or a portion of them. If all or substantially all risks and rewards are retained, then the transferred assets are not derecognized from the statement of financial position.
(v)          Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported on the statement of financial position when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted under IFRSs, or for gains and losses arising from a group of similar transactions such as in the Board’s trading activity.
(vi)        Fair value of financial assets and liabilities
Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability respectively in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
(h)         Impairment for non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Board’s non-financial assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists then the assets’ recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable asset group that generates cash flows that largely are independent from other assets and groups. Impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognized in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro-rata basis.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
(i)           Investment held for sale
Investment held for sale relates to investment in a subsidiary which is accounted for under IFRS 5 ‘Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations’. The investment is stated at the lower of its carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell.
(j)          Cash and cash equivalents
For the purposes of the statement of cashflows, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, bank balances and government securities maturing within 91 days from the date of issue.
 
(k)         Property and equipment
 
(i)           Recognition and measurement
Items of property and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.
(ii)         Subsequent costs
The cost of replacing part of an item of property or equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Board and its cost can be measured reliably. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property and equipment are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
(iii)        Depreciation
Depreciation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property and equipment as follows:
 
Long term leasehold land                                           Over the lease period
Buildings                                                                                     2%
Computer equipment                                                                   33.33%
ICT Equipment                                                                            20%
Office equipment, furniture and fittings                                       20%
Motor vehicles                                                                             25%
 
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each reporting date.
Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are determined by reference to their carrying amount and are recognized in profit or loss in the year in which they arise.
(l)           Related parties
In the normal course of business, the Board has entered into transactions with related parties. The related party transactions are at arm’s length.
(m)        Grants
Other grants are recognised initially as deferred income at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Board will comply with the conditions.
(n)         Comparatives
Where necessary, comparative figures have been adjusted or excluded to conform to changes in presentation in the current year.
 
(o)         New standards and interpretations
 
(i)           Adoption of new standards or amendments effective for the year ended 30 June 2014
 

New standard or amendments


Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 


Amendments to IFRS 7-Disclosures-Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.


1 January 2013


IFRS 13-Fair value measurement


1 January 2013


IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements - Presentation of items of Other Comprehensive Income (OCI)


1 January 2013
 

 
Other than IAS 1 and IFRS 13 as detailed below, the adoption of these standards did not have a significant impact on the amounts reported or presented in these financial statements.
 
(i)          IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income’ has been adopted for the first time for the financial year ended 30 June 2014.
The amendment requires that items presented within Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) be grouped separately into those items that will be recycled into profit or loss at a future point in time, and those items that will never be recycled. The amendment affects presentation only and therefore has no significant impact on the Board’s financial position or performance.
 
(ii)           IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ has been adopted for the first time for the financial year ended 30 June 2014.
IFRS 13 replaces the fair value measurement guidance contained in individual IFRSs with a single source of fair value measurement guidance. It defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and sets out disclosure requirements for fair value measurement. The standard does not provide a significant departure from the current application of fair value accounting highlighted under note 3 g (vi) and as expounded below.
 
Determination of fair value
Policy applicable from 1 January 2013
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Board has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk.
When available, the Board measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. If there is no quoted price in an active market, then the Board uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction.
 
Policy applicable before 1 January 2013 
Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s length transaction on the measurement date. When available, the Board measures the fair value of an instrument using quoted prices in an active market for that instrument. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available and represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis.
If a market for a financial instrument is not active, then the Board establishes fair value using a valuation technique. The chosen valuation technique makes maximum use of market inputs, relies as little as possible on estimates specific to the Board, incorporates all factors that market participants would consider in setting a price and is consistent with accepted economic methodologies for pricing financial instruments.
(iii)          Amendments to IFRS 7 Disclosures Transfers of Financial Assets. The amendments to IFRS 7 increase the disclosure requirements for transactions involving transfers of financial assets. These amendments are intended to provide greater transparency around risk exposures of transactions where a financial asset is transferred but the transferor retains some level of continuing exposure in the asset
The application of the amendment had no effect on the Board's financial statements as the Board did not transfer such financial assets during the year
(ii)         New standards and amendments not yet effective

Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions (Amendments to IAS 19)


1 July 2014

 
(i)           IFRS 9: Financial Instruments (2010)
It replaces parts of IAS 39 - Financial Instruments, Recognition and Measurement that relates to classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified, at initial recognition as either measured at fair value or at amortised cost. The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing its financial instruments and the characteristics of the contractual cash flows of the instrument. For financial liabilities, the standard retains most of the requirements of IAS 39. The main change is that, in cases where the fair value option is applied for financial liabilities, the part of a fair value change arising from a change in an entity’s own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income rather than the profit or loss, unless this creates an accounting mismatch.
The standard is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and will have an impact on the Board.
(ii)         Amendments to IAS 32: Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
The amendments address inconsistencies in current practice when applying the offsetting criteria in IAS 32, mainly by clarifying the meaning of “currently has a legally enforceable right of set-off” and that some gross settlement systems may be considered equivalent to net settlement. These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, with retrospective application
(iii)        Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27: Investment Entities (2012)
The amendments define “investment entities” and provide them an exemption from the consolidation of subsidiaries; instead, an investment entity is required to measure the investment in each eligible subsidiary at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9 / IAS 39 (the exception does not apply to subsidiaries that provide services relating to the investment entity’s investment activities). An investment entity is required to account for its investment in a relevant subsidiary in the same way in its consolidated and separate financial statements, and additional disclosures are introduced. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014,
The Directors do not anticipate any effect on the Board’s financial statements.
(iv)        Amendments to IAS 36: Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets (2013)
The amendments reduce the circumstances in which the recoverable amount of assets or cash-generating units is required to be disclosed, clarify the disclosures required, and introduce an explicit requirement to disclose the discount rate used in determining impairment (or reversals) where recoverable amount (based on fair value less costs of disposal) is determined using a present value technique. They are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
(v)          Amendments to IAS 39 titled Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting (June 2013)
The amendments permit the continuation of hedge accounting in a situation where a counterparty to a derivative designated as a hedging instrument is replaced by a new central counterparty (known as ‘novation of derivatives’ ), as a consequence of laws or regulations, if specific conditions are met.
(vi)        IFRIC 21: Levies (2013)
The interpretation provides guidance on when to recognise a liability for a levy imposed by a government. The obligating event for the recognition of a liability is the activity that triggers the payment of the levy in accordance with the relevant legislation. It also provides guidance on recognition of a liability to pay levies: the liability is recognised either progressively if the obligating event occurs over a period of time, or when the minimum threshold is reached if an obligation is triggered on reaching that minimum threshold. The interpretation is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
(vii)       Defined benefit plans – Employee contributions (Amendments to IAS 19)
The amendments clarify the requirements that relate to how contributions from employees or third parties that are linked to service should be attributed to periods of service. In addition, it permits a practical expedient if the amount of the contributions is independent of the number of years of service. 
The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2014, with earlier application being permitted.
The Board’s defined benefits scheme does not provide for employee contributions. The adoption of these changes would not affect the amounts and disclosures of the Board’s defined benefits obligations.
The Board did not early adopt new or amended Standards during the 2014 financial year and is in the process of assessing the impact.
 
4.            CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including experience of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
 
(a)         Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
(i)           Property and equipment
Critical estimates are made by the management in determining depreciation rates for property and equipment. The rates used are set out in the accounting policy for property and equipment.
(ii)         Impairment of receivables
The Board reviews its receivables’ portfolio regularly to assess the likelihood of impairment. This requires an estimation of the amounts that are irrecoverable especially debts incurred by institutions under liquidation.
 
(b)           Critical judgements in applying the entity’s accounting policies
In the process of applying the Board’s accounting policies, management has made judgements in determining whether assets are impaired.

No depreciation has been charged in arriving at the results for the year in respect of certain fully depreciated assets with a cost of KShs 5,836,970 (2013 - KShs 5,341,968) and are still in use. If depreciation had been charged during the year on the cost of these assets at normal rates it would have amounted to a charge to profit or loss of KShs 1,945,637 (2013 - KShs 1,780,638).

The Board owns 10,000,000 Ordinary shares of the Consolidated Bank of Kenya Limited that were acquired using a grant from the National Treasury for DPFB to resolve a banking crisis at the time. At the time of acquisition of the investment, the Banking Act allowed the Board to acquire, hold or dispose shares of an institution that might otherwise result in a loss to the Board. The Banking Act was later amended and now prevents the Board from holding investments other than in government securities. The Government, through the National Treasury plans to privatize Consolidated Bank and has therefore directed the Privatization Commission to explore and advise on how the shares are to be sold. A Consortium has been appointed to guide on the intended Privatization. Due to the above, the requirement for consolidation on IAS 27 does not apply.
The investment was last valued in December 2004 by external consultants and the value of the shares was considered to be effectively nil. In the opinion of the directors, the additional diminution in value of KShs 100,000, based on this valuation, is not material for recognition in the financial statements.
It is to be noted that enactment of the KDI Act, 2012, Section 6 allows the Deposit Insurer to acquire, hold shares, and make loans and advances for purposes of reducing or averting a risk to an institution or the financial system or a threatened loss to the Corporation.

18.                 RISK MANAGEMENT
Structure and reporting
The Board of Directors is responsible for the overall risk management approach and for approving the risk management policy and strategies. There are other organs that monitor the assessment and management of risks within the Board including;
Audit Committee of the Board
The Audit Committee assists the Board in the fulfilment of its oversight responsibilities. The Committee guides and monitors the implementation of controls by the Board.
Deposit Insurance and Risk Management Section
The Board has an established Deposit Insurance & Risk Management Section that receives off-site information on deposits from member institutions for analysis and works closely with Central Bank of Kenya to monitor the performance of the Banking industry.
Internal Audit and Risk Management Unit
The operations of the Board are subject to internal audit by the Internal Audit Unit of the Deposit Protection Fund Board. The Internal Audit Unit employs full scope audit approach in planning and carrying out its audit engagements. The business processes are assessed with regard to business continuity procedures, physical safety, system safety, conformity to legal requirements and regulations, sufficiency of human resources and information safety. In addition, the financial risks and reputation risks are also determined. 
Controls that are designed to reduce these risks to acceptable levels are assessed in terms of sufficiency and effectiveness; additional controls are recommended in order to increase effectiveness.
The main risks faced by the Board in respect of its principal non-derivative financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The directors review and agree on policies for managing these risks. The Board maintains a conservative policy regarding interest rate and liquidity risks. The Board does not engage in speculation in the markets. In addition, the Board does not speculate or trade in derivative financial instruments.
The Board’s principal financial instruments comprise investments held to maturity; cash and cash equivalents; receivables; payables and accruals and amounts due to related parties.
                
(a)           Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Board if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Board’s receivables, government securities and cash and bank balances.
The Board’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer and investment.
The Board establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of receivables and investments. The main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified. The collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was:

(b)           Market Risk

(ii)           Currency risk
The Board operates wholly within Kenya and its assets and liabilities are reported in the local currency. It does not transact in foreign currencies.
 
(c)            Liquidity risk management
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Board will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations from its financial liabilities. The Board’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Board’s reputation. In the course of its operations the Board invests its capital in forms that vary in liquidity ranging from government securities that are readily convertible and sundry receivables. Simultaneously it carries current liabilities in form of provisions for protected deposits, sundry payables and related party liabilities. The entity matches its current assets to the current liabilities falling due to mitigate the risk of low liquidity.
The Board’s financial liabilities amount to KShs 29,877,000 (2013 - KShs 28,272,000) and are all short term.
 
(d)           Fair value
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is the same as the carrying amounts as shown in the statement of financial position:

(e)            Capital management
The primary objectives of the Board’s capital management are to ensure that the Board maintains healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and to maximize the value for the insured depositors in member institutions. The Board manages its Fund and makes adjustments to it, as per the requirements of the Banking Act.

19.                 CONTIGENT LIABILITIES
 Litigation
Mr. Ajay Shah (former Managing Director of Trust Bank Limited) filed a case in 2002 claiming general damages and special damages amounting to KShs 144 million against Trust Bank Limited (In Liquidation) and the Board on allegations of defamation and publication of malicious false statements. The suit is pending hearing. No provision has been made in the financial statements because, in the opinion of the directors, the claim is unlikely to succeed and DPFB is sued as the Liquidator of Trust Bank Ltd (IL). Therefore, in case judgment is entered against DPFB, the costs shall be paid by Trust Bank Ltd (IL).
 20.                 AMOUNTS HELD ON BEHALF OF THIRD PARTIES
 
As at the year end, the Board in its role as a liquidator, held an amount of KShs 69.5 million in an escrow account on behalf of third parties, pending the completion of the transactions in accordance with contractual agreements.
